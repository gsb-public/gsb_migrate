1,4393,6/1/11 0:00,Professor Margaret Neale Named 2011 Davis Award Recipient,57,news/headlines/neale_davisaward.html,Neale is the 13th recipient and first woman to receive the Davis Award for lifetime achievement by a faculty member.,116,"<p>Margaret A. Neale, who showed that negotiation and teamwork are essential skills for managers, is the 2011 recipient of the Robert T. Davis Award, presented by the Stanford Graduate School of Business deans to recognize a colleague for a lifetime of service and achievement.</p>
<p>Neale, who is the John G. McCoy Banc One Corporation Professor of Organizations and Dispute Resolution, was honored at a faculty dinner that included some good-natured jibes about her record as an administrator and heartfelt thanks for her mentoring of many junior colleagues and for building the behavioral sciences at the school through example, tough love, and negotiation skills.</p>
<p>Besides teaching doctoral, MBA, and Sloan students, Neale works with managers from around the world who take two popular Executive Education programs that she directs: Managing Teams for Innovation and Success and Influence and Negotiation Strategies. She also co-directs the newer Executive Program for Women Leaders. A former student of pharmacy and psychology, Neale, better known to her colleagues as Maggie, latched onto business administration at a doctoral program at the University of Texas and taught at business schools at the University of Arizona and Northwestern University before joining the Stanford business school faculty in 1995.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2000, she also served as an academic associate dean with political scientist David Brady, who at the awards dinner teased that their joint administrative record could not be quantitatively verified. But he added that ""her mentoring of young professors, especially women, is outstanding. Her house is always open to colleagues and their families. Her relationship with graduate students is nurturing but firm. In short, she's done great things for the GSB, Stanford, and her profession.""</p>
<p>Professor Deborah Gruenfeld, who co-directs the Executive Program for Women Leaders with Neale, said she owed a huge debt to her senior colleague. She described Neale as ""whip-smart, fearless, and intimidating. Fiercely loyal, sometimes a little rough, tall, and from Texas. She likes to call the question. Maggie has no patience for nonsense, and she does not hesitate to let you know.""</p>
<p>Neale was already a ""giant"" in the field of organizational behavior when she arrived at Stanford, Gruenfeld said, ""having brought behavioral decision theory to the study of negotiations, and for bringing negotiations research out of the industrial relations arena, where it was seen as a marginal topic having mostly to do with unions, into the forefront of managerial interest, where it is now viewed as a process that is fundamental to management and exchange relationships of all kinds.""</p>
<p>Neale's research on demographic diversity in work teams also brought ""a much-needed theoretical perspective to a tangle of contradictory findings on the one hand, and a chorus of evangelism on the other.""</p>
<p>Neale used her negotiation skills to get funding, space, and staffing for a school-wide behavioral research lab, which increased research productivity and made it possible for the business school to recruit more behavioral scientists, according to Gruenfeld. ""The lab is a tremendous asset for the GSB, providing all kinds of support for the collection, coding, and analysis of behavioral data,"" Gruenfeld said. ""At last count, the behavioral lab was formally associated on the books with the publication of close to 60 peer-reviewed journal articles by GSB faculty and graduate students.""</p>
<p>When Neale arrived at Stanford, the organizational behavior group at the business school had 14 members and the school faculty advisory board had one female member. Sixteen years later, the OB group has nearly doubled, and the advisory board now has ""four women from the OB group alone,"" Gruenfeld said. While not scientific proof of cause and effect, Gruenfeld said she would assert that ""Maggie has been a catalyst, if not a necessary condition, for the growth and fortification of the OB group, the GSB research culture, the MBA curriculum, and Executive Education, as well as the changing face of the school.""</p>
<p>To which Neale added brief thanks for the honor and the observation that she had done nothing by herself for which she was being honored. ""My biggest achievement,"" she said, ""has been the opportunity to be here at Stanford building community with mentoring doctoral students and junior faculty, working with them to have their research have impact and for them to have impact in their institutions.""</p>
<p>Neale is the 13th recipient and the first woman to receive the Davis Award, which is given for lifetime achievement to a current faculty member. The award was endowed by family and friends of the late Robert T. Davis, the Kresge Professor of Marketing, who was a member of the business school faculty for 37 years.</p>

1,36621,6/17/12 0:00,Guideposts to Change,20,news/headlines/commencement-gsb-2012.html,"John Morgridge shares his ""Rules for the Long Road"" during the Stanford GSB's annual diploma ceremony.",102,"<p>""The choices you will make given your youth, your energy, your knowledge, and your experience will change your community, your country, and your world,"" John Morgridge told a group of 473 degree candidates during the Stanford GSB diploma ceremony on Saturday, June 16, at Frost Amphitheater.</p>
<p>The philanthropist and former CEO of Cisco, who received his MBA from Stanford in 1957 but didn't actually attend his own graduation because of the draft, distilled his eight decades of life experience into what he called his ""Rules for the Long Road."" In a series of warm reminiscences, Morgridge explicated eight fundamental principles to help guide the 2012 graduates on their individual life journeys of change.</p>
<p>Among them, he advised students to invest in friendships, set annual mental and physical challenges, learn to give back, and live your values. In his final rule of the day, he advised students to listen, but ""don't always be looking for a new opportunity."" He elaborated that, ""Opportunity is random and may come in many different forms.""</p>
<p>During Morgridge's military service, for example, Eisenhower shifted U.S. defense policy from a tactical to a strategic approach. As a result, the Stanford MBA graduate became the officer in charge of the IBM Documentation Center, which in turn led to a long and fruitful career in the computing industry.</p>
<p>His comments resonated with Dean Garth Saloner's own  observations to the graduates</a>, comments that honestly acknowledged the role that luck plays in our personal success and the obligations it creates.</p>
<p>""For each of us good fortune has played a role,"" he said, ""whether a helping hand along the way, a break on a college admissions decision, being born in the right place at the right time, or countless other reasons that others, with our same talent endowments, are less fortunately positioned. Surely, at least that portion of our success creates an obligation to give back, to share our largesse with others.""</p>
<h2>Degrees Awarded</h2>
<p>The afternoon ceremony honored 384 students who received MBA degrees, 19 PhDs, 67 who earned the Sloan Master of Science degree, and 3 Master of Arts in Business Research degrees. Of the students receiving MBA degrees, 22 also earned degrees in education, 5 earned degrees in law, 1 earned a Humanities and Sciences degree in public policy, and 18 were awarded earth sciences degrees from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.</p>
<p>Jesper Sørensen, the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior, acknowledged the efforts of 76 MBA and 19 Sloan graduates who also received a Public Management Certificate. This certificate is awarded to students who complete a course of study focused on using business and management skills to solve social and environmental issues.</p>
<h2>Students Share Perspectives</h2>
<p>In a new feature of the diploma ceremony, a student representative from the PhD, MBA, and Sloan programs shared their experiences and hopes before the degrees were granted for their cohort. Each individual highlighted the themes of fostering change and giving back.</p>
<p>Sloan student speaker Alex Zakroff fittingly took the GSB art installation ""Ways to Change"" as inspiration for his remarks. This dynamic piece of artwork is comprised of 300 backlit panels that display different adverbs modifying the verb <em>change</em>. ""I challenge you — as well as myself — to be very purposeful in choosing the words that will describe your change,"" he said. ""If you do, my bet is you will leave this world — and this place — better than you found it.""</p>
<p>Bora Keskin from the PhD program put it this way: ""As PhD graduates of the GSB, we are determined to make the world a better place either by highlighting the inefficiencies we see in various industries, organizations, and markets; by building business theories to guide practitioners; or by educating the next generation of executives and entrepreneurs.""</p>
<p>And before the presentation of the MBA diplomas, Ashley Lewis shared her thoughts about change being very close to home. ""We have been given opportunities and experiences that most people only ever dream of ""¦ how do we demonstrate that we were worthy of these extraordinary opportunities?"" she asked. ""We start to change things now, even before we have the power to do the big, important, universe-altering things. How do we do that? We teach people to be good to each other.""</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Every year, a few distinguished students are recognized with awards for outstanding accomplishments. For 2012, the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award was presented to Kevin Diestel. This award is given to a second-year MBA nominated and chosen by their peers as having contributed the most to the fulfillment of the goals of Stanford GSB, in their actions at the school and in society.</p>
<p>The academically highest 10% of the graduating MBA class is designated as Arjay Miller Scholars after Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller, who was on hand during the ceremony to recognize these 38 outstanding achievers. Among the students, one MBA student's academic achievement places him or her at the top of the class, earning the designation as the Henry Ford II Scholar. Christopher Bockman earned this designation for 2012, as well as being the recipient of the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance, which is granted to the MBA student selected by the Finance faculty for achievement in finance courses.</p>
<p>In a separate university ceremony, MBA student and co-president of the GSB Student Association Kathryn Jaxheimer was recognized for her service to the community with the James W. Lyons Award from Stanford University.</p>
<p>By the conclusion of the ceremony, it was clear that the students of the 2012 graduating class had chosen the ways in which they wished to change: ambitiously, gratefully, and caringly.</p>

The event marked the end of a three-year building project that produced a facility that will enable the business school to move forward and grow in the areas of curriculum and innovation.</p>
<p>""We're now able to turn the physical spaces that have been created here into intellectual learning places,"" Graduate School of Business Dean Garth Saloner said of the 8 new buildings on the 12.5-acre site.</p>
<p>Six hundred banners bearing words and phrases meant to inspire change, written by members of the GSB and Stanford communities, flowed from the new buildings. The banners echoed the business school's slogan: Change lives. Change organizations. Change the world. Visitors also had the chance to contribute their words of change on banners that <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stanford-Graduate-School-of-Business/208357009185713"">can be seen online</a> and will be displayed in the future.</p>
<p>Stanford President John Hennessy thanked the donors, many of whom were present at the dedication ceremony, for the new center, ""which is not only a gift for students today, who have already fallen in love with the place, but a gift for students of the future.""</p>
<p>Philip H. Knight, who earned his MBA at the school in 1962 and for whom the Knight Management Center is named, said that in the coming decade the school will redefine management. ""People come up to Penny [his wife] and me to thank us for making this possible,"" Knight said. ""I tell them it is an honor for us to be associated with a special institution.""</p>
<p>Knight wrote his business plan for Nike in a small business class at the school taught by the late Professor Frank Shallenberger.</p>
<p>Thousands of visitors, alumni, and members of the Stanford community toured the 8 buildings after the dedication ceremony and had the opportunity to see some of the 100 classrooms of various sizes that enable teaching a new curriculum in flexible learning spaces.</p>
<p>As visitors enjoyed the Stanford Gospel Choir and Mendicants a capella group, they had the chance to sample locally grown foods at the Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, coffee specialties from the TA Associates CafÃ©, and appetizers from Schwab Residential Center dining services. The crowd also sampled the terraces, patios, and shaded picnic benches, which are designed as spaces to meet, share a meal or cup of coffee, and think collaboratively.</p>
<p>The firm Hit and Run T-Shirts helped guests of the open house customize T-shirts bearing messages of change, while some visitors took self-guided tours of the 360,000-square-foot facility using cell phones to call in and learn about specific locations and features of the buildings.</p>
<p>The green features of the sustainably designed center, which is seeking a <a href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222"">LEED</a> Platinum® rating for environmental sustainability from the U.S. Green Building Council, were visible during the open house, including the roof-mounted photovoltaic panels; the long, narrow buildings that allow more natural light in; and the 870-space underground parking structure that eliminates the ""heat-island effect"" of traditional uncovered parking lots.</p>
<p>Visitors also had the chance to view the public art pieces dedicated to change, such as the cornerstone that reads: ""Dedicated to the things that haven't happened yet and the people who are about to dream them up"" or the Monument to Change as it Changes, a wall composed of panels that constantly change color, creating constant movement and different patterns.</p>

1,79326,1/16/13 0:00,The Reinvention Machine,23,news/headlines/reinvention-machine,Why and how Silicon Valley thrives — from one of its founding fathers.,70,"<p>Perched on Franklin ""Pitch"" Johnson's desk is a four-inch steel ingot, a silent reminder of his first civilian job out of business school: a melter foreman in charge of several open-hearth furnaces in a steel mill in East Chicago, Ind. In 1962 Johnson left behind the grit and swelter of the mill to move back home to Palo Alto, Calif., and start an investment firm. Unaware of it at the time, Johnson was about to become one of the founding fathers of the world's most efficient startup machine: Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>""A burst of entrepreneurial activity took place that dwarfed any other period in the history of the United States,"" Johnson wrote in a paper on entrepreneurship in 1998. ""What occurred in the next few decades was nothing less than an entrepreneurial revolution that shook the country and the world.""</p>
<p>Since 1960 Silicon Valley has spawned 32,000 high-tech companies. Cities the world over have tried to replicate the magic of the valley but none have yet been able to create an environment that fosters entrepreneurship, disruption, and invention on the same scale.</p>
<p>Johnson knows something about winning, not only from his career but also from his childhood. His father, Franklin Pitcher Johnson, was an Olympic hurdler who went on to become the track coach at Stanford. Johnson Jr., also known as ""Pitch,"" showed promise in track and field, which earned him a full scholarship to Stanford. When the atom bomb went off in 1945, however, Johnson's interests turned to physics, and he pursued a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. He earned a degree from Harvard Business School and served in the Air Force before going to work at the steel mill.</p>
<p>He returned to California, and in 1962, Johnson partnered with Bill Draper (the father of Timothy Draper, a well-known venture capitalist and cofounder of Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson) and founded Draper and Johnson Investment Company, one of the very first venture capital firms. Together, they visited university labs and knocked on doors of newly formed companies to unearth promising new inventions in which they could invest. Three years later Johnson launched his own firm, Asset Management Company, which has invested in more than 200 tech startups, including Amgen, Biogen, and Tandem. Johnson also developed and taught a course on venture capital at Stanford Graduate School of Business for 12 years. The class is still being taught today.</p>
<p>Johnson recently discussed his insights into why and how Silicon Valley continues to thrive.</p>
<h2>You've been part of helping other regions in the world to become centers of entrepreneurial activity. While many of these places have gotten better at this, Silicon Valley continues to dominate. Why?</h2>
<p>There are many conditions that allow Silicon Valley to thrive. First, in the U.S., we have had relatively moderate tax rates for capital gains. In the Bay Area we have three great research universities: UCSF [University of California, San Francisco]; Cal [University of California, Berkeley], and Stanford University. Those schools produce students and attract professors who know a lot about technology, and they produce the knowledge and research that leads to the creation of companies.</p>
<p>People forget San Francisco and Silicon Valley have their roots in pioneering. Failure is not unthinkable here. You can try again.</p>
<p>In some places in Europe, however, it is a disgrace to fail and you have to retreat from business life. Most Silicon Valley business inhabitants understand that great technology means very little unless it can serve or create a marketplace. I go to Russia, and it's pulling teeth to get them to talk about anything but the technology itself. Once entrepreneurs come up with a scheme to move their technology ideas into the market, they need money. Here, we have an abundance of venture capital. In many places in the world, you need a rich friend or an uncle.</p>
<h2>You have invested in more than 200 companies. Of which investment are you most proud? What made it so successful?</h2>
<p>Amgen. It got to be the biggest, and I had a major role along with Bill Bowes. Amgen serves the medical community with really important products. We make it possible for people to not get anemic when they have kidney dialysis. We picked a superb leader, George Rathmann, and created a great company that does a lot of good for patients. The principal purpose was always serving patients.</p>
<h2>What was your worst investment, and what made it fail?</h2>
<p>Any investment, when you get zero money back, is the worst. I've done that several times. When I have failed, it's been because in my due diligence I didn't see the mode of failure. Often it was the inability to get along with other people, or they couldn't build a business because no one wanted to do business with them.</p>
<h2>What do you look for in a venture investment?</h2>
<p>This is a big argument between me and my good friend Don Valentine, a founding partner of Sequoia Capital. The first thing you look for in an entrepreneur is a sense of integrity, honesty, openness, and decency. Once you think you have found a decent person, the second thing is: Do they have a clear vision of the marketplace they want to serve? Don believes that you need decent people, but the marketplace comes first, because you can't change that, but you can change the people. We both ask: Do they have a differentiated ability? Is their product workable? Do they have enough of a different idea that they will be free of certain kinds of competition? Will the business operate with good margins?</p>
<h2>What are the most important characteristics of winning entrepreneurs?</h2>
<p>They must have a strong desire to compete and win, an intuitive understanding of marketplaces and how to serve them, and a deep understanding of technology and how it can be used to serve marketplaces. Those three things are fundamental. A fourth is high integrity and decent behavior. If you don't have that you will have a short run at success but you won't make it long term. Also, I have never met a successful entrepreneur who didn't have zeal.</p>
<h2>What mistakes do you see entrepreneurs make most often?</h2>
<p>Running out of money. Often they plan to grow faster than reality will permit. They are too optimistic.</p>
<h2>What mistakes do you see venture capitalists make most often?</h2>
<p>Very large venture firms have trouble doing small deals but the companies that end up being terrific investments often start as very small deals. Another mistake is getting impatient. We used to know it took five to seven years to build a company from scratch and take it public. Now, so many companies do it in their first year or two of life.</p>
<h2>What should entrepreneurs look for in a venture capitalist?</h2>
<p>They should look for someone who can provide active help. It could mean contacts to customers or making judgments about strategy, tactics, and business plans. I've even worked booths at trade shows to lend a hand. They need someone they can feel comfortable telling the highlights and the lowlights. They should ask themselves: Does this venture capitalist want to win as badly as I do?</p>
<h2>What is the best business advice you have ever received?</h2>
<p>When we were first starting our firm, a lawyer, Ed Huddleson, said to Bill and me: ""We can write all the investment agreements you want but if you have to bring them out of the drawer, something has gone wrong. Invest in people you can believe in, and you will never need to take the papers out of the drawer.""</p>
<h2>What do you think is the next great wave of technical development?</h2>
<p>A continuation of the move into handheld devices and the use of those devices for communications as well as complex functions in the Cloud; widespread use of individual human genomes to design drugs and treatments; the use of human stem cells and cells derived from stem cells to treat a large number of conditions and ailments.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the conference, the Stanford University School of Medicine, in collaboration with the Stanford GSB, invited <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/stefanos-zenios"">Stefanos Zenios</a>, faculty organizer of the summit, to respond to reader questions on health care innovation and entrepreneurship using the hashtag #AskSUMed or the comment section on the medical school's <a href=""http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Scope</a> blog.</p>
<p>An expert on innovation, Zenios is the founding director of the business school's Program in Healthcare Innovation. His responses are below:</p>
<p>[@NBBJCommunity tweet]</p>
<p>Let's take <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing"">LEAN</a> as an example. LEAN has its roots in the Toyota production system and process re-engineering. One of the key insights from the Toyota production system is that each handoff, when an item changes hands between individuals or departments, in a service system or production process is a potential point of failure.</p>
<p>In health care, many preventable problems and medical errors occur at handoffs between staff members or during shift changes. You can use technology to make those handoffs work more seamlessly. You can start with things like electronic medical records to help reduce workflow failures. But you can also envision medical technologies that can be used to radically redesign the process of care delivery to eliminate handoffs. For instance, consider devices that could be used by a patient to perform activities and collect data that would otherwise be gathered and managed by a health care provider. If we can integrate that information in a way that works seamlessly with the provider's workflow, we can minimize the back and forth between the provider and patient that creates room for error.</p>
<h2>Graeme <a href=""http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2012/04/ask-stanford-med-stefanos-zenios-taking-questions-on-health-care-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/#comment-79049"" target=""_blank"">asks</a>: As the number of uninsured Americans continues to <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/14/number-of-uninsured-in-us_n_1276189.html"" target=""_blank"">rise</a>, how can the biodesign process be modified to develop devices that can be used in low-resource health care settings such as public hospitals and clinics?</h2>
<p>This is a great question because it's something we've been thinking about over the last four years. Through collaboration with the <a href=""http://www.chcf.org/"" target=""_blank"">California HealthCare Foundation</a>, we've been partnering with safety net hospitals in the Bay Area to identify needs and potential solutions to their problems using the biodesign process. And, what we've learned is that there are few basic modifications needed for the process to be effective in these environments.</p>
<p>First, it's essential to get the need right. Safety-net hospitals and clinics operate very differently than private or academic health providers. So you have to spend time in these low-resource settings to really understand their needs and their constraints. Second, when creating the need specification, or what my colleagues in Stanford's <a href=""http://dschool.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">d.school</a> would call the design requirements, you have to be sure that affordability is among your main criteria. And third, solutions designed for low-resource settings are most likely to get funding from foundations, nonprofits and government agencies, which create different opportunities and constraints for the innovator.</p>
<p>In terms of <a href=""http://biodesign.stanford.edu/bdn/video/20080204_GeorgeKembel_bioe374.jsp"" target=""_blank"">ideation</a> and solution design, one successful approach has been for innovators to look at an effective, currently available technology for addressing a particular problem and then redesign it to be more affordable. A great example that came out of the GSB <a href=""http://biodesign.stanford.edu/bdn/courses/bioe374.jsp"">Biodesign and Innovation course</a> is the <a href=""http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2011/february/ventilator-0214.html"" target=""_blank"">OneBreath ventilator</a>. On this project, the team figured out how to design a ventilator for use in the ICU that would cost one-tenth of current ventilators. The startup is now targeting low-resource health care providers outside the U.S. But once the technology is proven, there's no reason why we couldn't start using it in the U.S., as long as it provides the same quality and meets the same specifications as the more expensive device.</p>

Can you provide examples of device makers or processes investors in this space might use to identify opportunities that can deliver health care value instead?</h2>
<p>We are definitely seeing the emergence of more value-based innovations in the device field. One sector that seems to be flourishing in this arena is <a href=""http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth/about/telehealth/"" target=""_blank"">telehealth</a>, which enables the delivery of health services remotely. It changes the venue of care with the intent of simultaneously reducing costs and supporting better health outcomes.</p>
<p>For instance, before telehealth, patients with <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000158.htm"" target=""_blank"">congestive heart failure</a> would have their weight monitored at periodic physician visits to make sure they weren't accumulating too much fluid. However, this would be part of a costly office visit and the timing of the appointment may or may not have corresponded with when the patient most at-risk. With a telehealth solution, you might have a device manufacturer that has designed a weight scale with wireless connectivity. So every day when congestive heart failure patients weigh themselves at home, their data is transmitted to call center where an agent or nurse is alerted if something looks out of the ordinary. The patient receives a call right away so the intervention is immediate. They don't have to wait until their next doctor's appointment to learn that something is wrong, which is good for the patient and better for the health-care system.</p>
<p>The challenge is that it still remains to be seen whether models like this will be commercially viable. Through the implementation of <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ACO/index.html?redirect=/ACO/"" target=""_blank"">Accountable Care Organizations</a>, the <a href=""http://democrats.senate.gov/pdfs/reform/patient-protection-affordable-care-act-as-passed.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> could make it possible for health providers to be reimbursed for providing these kinds of preventive health services. However, so much uncertainty exists that many investors are hesitant to back these important value-based devices.</p>
<h2>Allison Davis, Stanford GSB admissions, <a href=""http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2012/04/ask-stanford-med-stefanos-zenios-taking-questions-on-health-care-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/#comment-80397"">asks</a>: Our prospective applicants often ask about the different teaching methods that our faculty use and why they use them. <a href=""http://biodesign.stanford.edu/bdn/courses/bioe374.jsp"" tareget=""_blank"">Biodesign Innovation</a> is a heavily hands-on course while in <a href=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/phi/students/courses/innovation-management.html"" target=""_blank"">Innovation and Management in Health Care</a>, you also use cases and lectures. Could you please comment on the different methods you use, and why you use them.</h2>
<p>At the GSB, we have three primary teaching methods: case-based, lecture, and experiential learning. Lectures are best when we're introducing new frameworks. Cases give students an understanding of how frameworks and other concepts are applied using real-world situations as a backdrop. And experiential learning opportunities allow students to gain deep, first-hand experience applying the concepts being taught to completely new situations that haven't before been tackled.</p>
<p>In general, these three methods work well together. For example, if students hope to learn about health economics, they would most likely start with a lecture in Rob Chess' Innovation and Management in Healthcare course. Once they understand the fundamentals, they would do a case on health-care economics that asks them to consider how a certain payer applies these principles to make its reimbursement and coverage decisions. Going one-step further, students in courses like Biodesign or Design for Service Innovation would undertake projects that require them to apply their understanding of health economics to create a business case for a new health product or service.</p>
<p>So you can see how the methods build upon one another so that students understand new information and analytical ways of thinking, learn to apply these concepts, and then understand them more deeply through hands-on experience.</p>

<p>Absolutely! If you look at the projections for future budget deficits, they are driven by entitlement programs such as Medicare and social security. When these programs were designed, life expectancy was much shorter than it is today. The expectation was that most people would retire at 65 and they would only live a few years longer. Now average life expectancy is pushing 80, and with progress in medical technology it's going to increase more and more. So we have to find a way to fund these entitlement programs that will cover health-care expenses as people live many years into their retirements.</p>
<p>We know that the current Medicare system is not sustainable. Given the changing demographics and advances in medical technology, we need a sustainable Medicare solution.</p>
