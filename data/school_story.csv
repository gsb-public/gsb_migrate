1,4398,9/1/10 0:00,Classroom Experiment Toys with Virtual World ,45,news/headlines/news-virtual.html,A five-day MBA course on putting together a business plan took place in an online environment as part of a distance-learning experiment.,136,"<p>A group of Stanford MBA students briefly left the brick and mortar of traditional classrooms this fall for a virtual-world setting, one where they could communicate through multiple channels or fly. Yes, fly. During the one-week course, students met online in a virtual classroom — using computer-generated avatars as facsimiles of themselves — to hammer out a business plan and present it to a group of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.</p>
<p>""We chose a challenging target to see what it's like,"" said Haim Mendelson, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Professor of Electronic Business and Commerce and Management, who noted that a business plan requires intensive human interaction, often a drawback of traditional distance-learning methods. To meet that challenge, Mendelson and lecturer Steve Ciesinski turned to Second Life, an online environment for meeting people and sharing knowledge that simulates real-world people, markets, places, and issues.</p>
<p>Students used personal computers to participate in lectures, make presentations and work with their team members. A virtual classroom accommodated the students who were divided into two teams that worked on customizable sneakers or the selling of electric bicycles in the United States. The avatars ranged from ones resembling typical grad students to those with wings.</p>
<p>In addition to flying, a feature reserved until the final day of the virtual-world class, the students were able to communicate using many channels. ""Traditionally students raise their hand, make a comment, and discussion ensues,"" Mendelson said. ""Using Second Life, students could communicate in parallel, whether that involved their actual voice or chats that were one-on-one, within their project team, with the instructor, with whomever was in their neighborhood, or all those scenarios simultaneously."" The two teams presented their business plans, in the flesh, to venture capitalists as well as the entrepreneurs who had come up with the original concepts for the shoes and bicycles.</p>
<p>The net effect isn't yet clear to Mendelson, who believes the forum increased productivity in some areas and reduced it in others. He's now polling all students for their reactions. Some welcomed the technology and others said the learning curve for Second Life was steep.</p>
<p>""Looking forward, you could do things in this environment that would be impossible in a traditional classroom,"" Mendelson said. Take the business plan for the customizable sneakers. The product could be designed and ""manufactured"" in Second Life and then distributed and sold through the virtual world's existing stores, letting the online market test the demand at different price points. ""There's a lot we can learn from the buying behavior of people in Second Life, especially for products that capitalize on self-expression,"" he said. ""Although there are differences between the real world and the virtual world.""</p>
<p>""For now it's too early to tell what Stanford GSB will do with this approach,"" Mendelson said. ""But we are already experimenting with a variety of distance-learning technologies.""</p>

1,4346,4/15/11 0:00,Stanford Graduate School of Business Opens its New Home,55,news/headlines/knightmanagementcenteropens.html,The $345 million Knight Management Center will enable innovative curriculum in one of the world's most sustainable business school facilities.,142,"<p>On April 29, Stanford University will celebrate the opening of the Knight Management Center at the Graduate School of Business, one of the world's most sustainable and innovative business school facilities. As the new home for the business school, the Knight Center is a central element in the school's forward vision for management education in the 21st century. By pushing boundaries as an educational innovator, the Stanford Graduate School of Business is leading the way in curricular as well as physical design improvements to ensure future leaders receive the finest education as they prepare to tackle the world's most difficult problems.</p>
<p>Funding for the $345 million facility of eight environmentally sustainable buildings on 12.5 acres was led by Nike founder Philip H. Knight, MBA '62, who contributed the $105 million down payment for the project in 2006, the largest gift ever to a business school at the time. ""The 2011 opening of the Knight Management Center is an inflection point for the Stanford Graduate School of Business,"" said Garth Saloner, the Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""The new facility fosters the innovative thinking and collaboration required of Stanford GSB students and serves as a launch pad for new courses and programs, as well as a platform from which our faculty will create cutting edge management knowledge in the years to come.""</p>
<p>The opening comes at a time when the school is stretching its vision for management education and thinking deeply about new methods of delivering compelling content and experiences that transform and prepare students from across the globe.</p>
<h2>Interdisciplinary Learning</h2>
<p>From its location in Silicon Valley, the Stanford GSB's Knight Center engages faculty and students across Stanford University, alumni, some 2,000 global executives annually, and the broader world community. The center supports increased interdisciplinary learning that exposes students to problem-solving across fields and professions. For example, the center's NGP CoLab space, without fixed desks, houses collaborative design-thinking classes that bring together medical, business, and engineering students. The 600-person CEMEX Auditorium in Zambrano Hall features university-wide programming to engage non-business students from across campus. ""It's a virtual world, but it is face-to-face interactions-often that happen in serendipitous fashion-that are still critical to the way much of great innovation takes place,"" said Stanford University President John Hennessy. ""The foresight and generosity of Phil Knight and our other valued donors make this possible. We can't predict the most interesting new ideas that will be born at the Graduate School of Business, but they will be created there.""</p>
<p>The Knight Management Center enables Stanford's innovative and expanding global curriculum. In addition to the fundamental canon of business knowledge, the MBA Program introduced in 2007 includes critical analytical thinking in small seminars, a global experience requirement, innovative problem solving, and personal leadership development. In support of that, the Knight Center offers flexible classroom spaces for hands-on experiential learning, small-group leadership labs, and team-based learning.</p>
<p>This approach stretches beyond core MBA, Sloan Master's, PhD, and Executive Education programs to the school's newest offerings. For example, in January, the school introduced a new 20-week evening certificate Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship for working professionals in engineering and the sciences and non-business graduate students. As the school develops new models for delivering these capabilities, it is also looking for original ways it can deliver management education beyond its walls. In March, with the School of Engineering, the business school was part of Stanford University's recent response to New York City's request for <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/march/new-york-proposal-031711.html"" target=""_blank"">expressions of interest</a> in the development of an applied sciences and graduate education campus that will serve as a hub for innovation and growth in that city. The school is also expanding its executive education offerings in China, India, and Brazil.</p>
<h2>Creating Ideas and Convening Discussion</h2>
<p>In addition to preparing leaders to positively shape the organizations they serve, the Graduate School of Business is a source of groundbreaking research and a convener of ideas. With three Nobel laureates in economics since 1990 and a world-class faculty across disciplines from organizational behavior to finance, the school's thought leadership is pervasive and enduring. Now the new 400-person Oberndorf Event Center will allow an expanded portfolio of thought leadership conferences. The first of these, the Stanford Finance Forum, cosponsored with Stanford Law School, will bring together regulators, bankers, and academics in June. In addition to the conference center, two Cisco TelePresence systems allow remote cross-campus and global classroom communications.</p>
<h2>Indoor, Outdoor Spaces</h2>
<p>Beyond academic activities, a purposeful open building design-including the attractive outdoor and late-night Arbuckle Dining Pavilion and TA Associates café will draw students and faculty from Stanford's six other world-class schools of engineering, law, medicine, earth sciences, education, and humanities and sciences to foster informal as well as formal interaction.</p>
<p>More than a half-dozen art pieces populate the open landscape, including <em>Monument to Change As It Changes</em>, a wall of moving squares that evokes the aspirations of the school's slogan: ""Change Lives. Change Organizations. Change the World."" Another lighted installation is titled Ways to Change. ""One of the things I like best about the new complex is the cornerstone,"" said Dean Saloner. ""It reads, 'Dedicated to the things that haven't happened yet and the people who will dream them up.' — This certainly captures the aspiration of the Stanford GSB.""</p>
<h2>Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>With the new Knight Management Center, the Stanford Graduate School of Business also aims to demonstrate to students, the business community, alumni, and the general public its commitment to environmental leadership. The 360,000-square-foot complex underscores a focus on responsible management of energy and water resources that is woven into core MBA classes covering sustainability across the functions of business, in the school's MBA/MS Environment and Resources joint degree program, and in electives such as Environmental Entrepreneurship and Environmental Science for Managers and Policy Makers. In practice, the school will, for example, derive 12% of its energy needs from solar panels, and 90% of interior spaces are lit with natural light to reduce electrical usage.</p>
<h2>Generous Alumni</h2>
<p>More than 200 alumni of the school contributed to the project, which broke ground in September 2008. In addition to Phil Knight, lead donors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Richard E. Rainwater, MBA '68</li>
<li>Anne T. Bass, MLA '07 and Robert M. Bass, MBA '74</li>
<li>Lorenzo H. Zambrano, MBA '68 and CEMEX</li>
<li>Cynthia Fry Gunn, AB '70, and John A. Gunn, AB '65, MBA '72</li>
<li>Stephanie Palmer McClelland, BS '70, MS '72, and W. Carter McClelland, BS '67, MBA '73</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the eight buildings, called the MBA Class of 1968 Building, is so named for the class whose members, including Rainwater, came together to fund a significant portion of the project. In a 2008 video interview with former Dean Robert L. Joss, Knight recalled his Small Business Management professor Frank Shallenberger, in whose class he prepared the first blueprint for Nike. ""He was inspirational and he was really motivating,"" said Knight. ""His class motto was: 'The only time you must not fail is the last time you try.' The class contributed mightily to my having the confidence and enthusiasm to start everything that led to Nike. I hope the new campus will inspire many generations to come.""</p>
<p>Planning for the Knight Management Center began a decade ago under the guidance of then-Dean Joss. The Advisory Council of senior alumni urged Joss to expand beyond a single building plan to create an entirely new complex that would last 75 years into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Under Joss' watch, the school raised the necessary funds and embarked on an architectural design around a series of smaller buildings with varied social and academic spaces that would reflect both the sense of community and collaboration at the Stanford GSB, as well as encourage the innovative spirit present across Stanford University. ""The best buildings in the world derive from a clear sense of what people want them to become,"" said Stan Boles, principal architect for <a href=""http://www.boora.com/"" target=""_blank"">Boora Architects</a>, which designed the Knight Center. ""We were inspired by the Stanford Graduate School of Business vision for educating the world's future leaders. Innovation and collaboration are paramount.""</p>
<p>Boora Architects of Portland, Ore., which has a strong practice in environmentally sustainable building systems and also designed four buildings in the new Science and Engineering Quad at Stanford, was the lead architectural firm on the large-scale project and completed the building with Turner Construction. Other key contractors included Arup Engineering, landscape architect Peter Walker and Partners, pre-design architect Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, and master planner William Rawn Associates.</p>
<h2>April 29 Open House 2-5 pm</h2>
<p>The April 29 opening will feature an Open House for the general public, as well as for all Stanford University students, faculty, and staff, from 2 to 5pm Festivities will include a debate on leadership by Stanford GSB faculty members Jeff Pfeffer and Joel Peterson at 2:30pm; music by the Stanford Band and campus a cappella groups; and food from Bon Appetit in the Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, Coupa Café at TA Associates café, and the Schwab Residential Center chef. Prizes, custom-made T-shirts, and other activities will contribute to a lively afternoon as the Stanford Graduate School of Business ushers in a new era with this new facility.</p>",,,,,,4347,Our Campus | Visit Us,stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus | visit,,,,,,,,,,,KMC | Bass,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/knight-center-street.jpg | https://public-prod-acquia.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/all/images/Knight-night_bass_3.jpg,Knight Management Center | Bass Center,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,,,,Nike,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,8796,3/19/12 0:00,Harnessing Mobile Tech and Students to Promote Development in Kenya,67,news/headlines/cohen-mobile-kenya.html,Stanford students and faculty partner with Kenyan organizations to reduce urban poverty through novel applications of mobile phone technology.,142,"<p>Can strategic applications of mobile technology yield benefits in the developing world? Stanford professor Joshua Cohen thinks so. But he also emphasizes that applications need to pay careful attention to design and to be founded on strong relationships. His course, <em>Designing Liberation Technologies,</em> brings small interdisciplinary teams of Stanford students together with students from the University of Nairobi and local NGOs to design new uses of mobile platforms for promoting human development in Nairobi's informal settlements.</p>
<p>At a forum on alleviating poverty in March organized by the <a href=""http://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies (SEED)</a> Cohen shared some ideas from his course, which he has been teaching since 2010 at Stanford's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design with Terry Winograd from Stanford's Computer Science Department. The course is premised on the idea that mobile tech is indeed a promising means for providing what Cohen calls ""jumpstarts in human welfare."" After the conference, Marguerite Rigoglioso interviewed Cohen, the Marta Sutton Weeks Professor of Ethics in Society and codirector of the Program on Liberation Technologies, which sits in Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI).</p>
<h2>Why does your course focus on Kenya?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: Kenya is filled with challenges and opportunities. Challenges, because Kenya is a pretty low-income country. Using the U.N.'s human development index, it is number 147 of 182 countries. The average life expectancy is about 57 years, and health care services are not only expensive but also severely overstretched. In Kenya's capital, Nairobi, Kibera is the second largest informal settlement in Africa — home to hundreds of thousands of people crammed into a space about 75% the size of Manhattan's Central Park. In Kibera and other informal settlements — for example, Mathare — there are very limited municipal services, and most residents have to purchase necessities such as potable water. Kenya also represents opportunities —— it is an emerging hub of innovation in information technology, so there is great potential for interesting projects. Moreover, the informal settlements are filled with energy and enterprise.</p>
<h2>Why do you take the use of mobile applications in areas of health, education, and economic development as the starting point?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: Economic growth is important for human development, and technology is a big driver of that growth. Mobile is, in fact, the most rapidly growing technology, particularly in the developing world. In 2000, there were 16 million mobile subscriptions in Africa; in 2008, there were 376 million. In Kenya, whereas only 22% of the population has internet access, most people have mobile phones. And those phones provide access to a wide array of services, from banking to shopping. So mobile technology is now native in much of the world. That said, mobile is good for addressing challenges that come from costly information but may not be especially helpful in addressing other challenges — in particular, the lack of decent public goods.</p>
<h2>How can student projects be appropriately crafted to serve the real needs of Kenyans?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: This is where what we call ""human-centered design"" comes in, something that the d.school specializes in. It's a problem-solving process that involves starting with the potential users themselves. From there, you develop insights about how to think about the needs of users, and then you brainstorm across disciplinary boundaries to develop and test prototypes. In our course we start by having some students travel to Nairobi, where they collaborate with Nairobi-based organizations that work in the informal settlements (Umande Trust, Mathare Youth Sports Association), as well as faculty and students from the University of Nairobi's School of Computing and Informatics. That collaboration continues through the course through electronic communication. At the end, we have people from the organizations come to Stanford to help us evaluate the projects and decide whether it makes sense to continue them. If the partners are interested and the students decide to continue, the project teams can travel to Nairobi to explore possibilities for developing their projects further.</p>
<h2>What are some of the issues that Stanford student projects have addressed?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: We've had a wealth of worthy projects involving the use of mobile phones for things like locating malaria drugs and checking them for counterfeiting, helping health workers collect patient information and control patient workflow, and helping pregnant women to save money for prenatal care.</p>
<h2>What kinds of pilots have you launched?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: On March 29, 2012, we will be initiating a six-month pilot for a project called M-Maji in five villages in Kibera. The aim is to help people find clean water, especially when there are water shortages. The pilot will be implemented by Umande Trust, a water and sanitation organization in Kibera. It uses mobile technology to have water sellers report to a server on water availability, price, and quality. Buyers can then access that information on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>Another pilot project, called Nishauri, allows users in Mathare to send questions on HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases via mobile phone to HIV counseling and treatment sites run by the Mathare Youth Sports Association. We hope it will change behaviors and reduce risk and infection, but we are still at the stage of figuring out how exactly to do a field experiment that will test the idea. This project, like all of the pilots that have come out of the course, has had key support from the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law and from FSI's new Global Underdevelopment Action Fund.</p>
<h2>Any projects that haven't yielded the results you wanted?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: One of our projects — Safe Mathare — was geared toward helping women in Mathare, where it is dangerous to walk alone, particularly at dawn and dusk. The initial design enrolled escorts through the Office of the District Officer for Mathare, who walked around with GPS-enabled phones. The phones would transmit their location, and users would access that information on their mobile phones so they could link up with the nearest escorts. The initial design faced lots of problems. After three months, a couple of escorts were assaulted, and there were reports of ethnic favoritism by the escorts and efforts to bribe them. On the positive side, the introduction of this system prompted some efforts by women to call each other to walk together. The team is now digging deeper — returning to the need-finding phase of the design process — to understand better how to achieve greater personal safety in Mathare.</p>
<h2>How can academic research best be used to help alleviate poverty in the developing world?</h2>
<p><strong>Cohen</strong>: It's easy to think that, with the right technology or the right design method, we can solve lots of problems. I think that view is seriously misguided. In our course, all of our projects are relationship intensive. We have worked hard to build partnerships at the University of Nairobi, where we now have friends and colleagues. And we have also worked hard to build collaborations with the Nairobi-based organizations that make it possible for our students to do these projects. Our idea is that if we can build and strengthen these ties, maybe we can help the organizations address challenges they have not yet been able to tackle. In the end, the projects will only work if they are owned by the partner organizations. You have to approach these issues with lots of humility, with an appreciation of why the challenges are so hard to overcome, how the best intentions go astray, how important it is to be persistent and committed, and how essential it is to increase the capacity of existing organizations, which are filled with smart, serious, dedicated people.</p>",,,,,,,Program on Global Justice,http://globaljustice.stanford.edu/,,,,,,,,,,,Cohen,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/cohenj.jpg,"An interview with Joshua Cohen, Stanford professor of law, political science, and philosophy, and director of the Program on Global Justice at Freeman Spogli Institute.

1,79106,12/13/12 0:00,"""An Intergenerational Transfer of Education""",44,news/headlines/international-transfer-education,C-suite leaders challenge MBA students to lead under pressure.,62,"<p>Wearing black suits and chanting ""we will rock you,"" as if to overwhelm opponents, nearly 400 first year MBA students start their day on a mission. They soon meet their match, however — nearly 200 high-ranking executives come from near and far to test the younger men's and women's leadership mettle.</p>
<p>This is the Executive Challenge where alumni and students role-play tough leadership situations. A December event in its 7<sup>th</sup> year at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, it is a not-to-be-missed affair for some very busy people.</p>
<p>""I come because it's tremendously fun to feel the energy from the students,"" said Himanshu Choksi, MBA '89, managing director of venture capital firm Pacifica Fund, not far from campus.</p>
<p>""It jazzes me,"" added James Craft, MBA '83, an antitrust lawyer who flew in from Phoenix where he is a partner in the law firm <a href=""http://www.gblaw.com/"" target=""_blank"">Gammage & Burnham</a>. ""Hopefully, I'm providing some feedback that makes a difference to the students, and I also learn from this that I need to listen better.""</p>
<p>""I come to see how the students are doing and to find out what's going on at the GSB,"" said Ashley Leeds, MBA '84, a partner at RIME Communcations Capital in New York.</p>
<p>The event is ""a safe place for students to take risks, to stretch their thinking,"" added classmate Emily Maddox Liggett, CEO of <a href=""http://www.novatorque.com/"" target=""_blank"">NovaTorque Inc.</a> in Fremont, Calif.</p>
<p>""It is intergenerational transfer of education at its best,"" said school Dean Garth Saloner.</p>
<p>From the students' point of view, the personal advice is taken in deeply because of the source, said MBA student Gabriel Dobbs. ""These people who role-play with us have been in a lot of boardrooms and dealt with so many tough situations.""</p>
<p>Take for example, the advice from serial entrepreneur Steven Aldrich, MBA '95, who took a day out of running <a href=""http://outright.com/"" target=""_blank"">Outright Inc.</a>, which he just sold to Go Daddy, because he said he likes to repay the favor of older GSB alums who helped him get his first company started. After a role-playing session where he was an observer while two students worked to get an approval from four alumni board members, Aldrich was concrete with his advice.</p>
<p>""You got each board member's feedback. That was very good,"" he told the students. ""But you went down to a gnat's eyelash on answering some of their questions. You can stop part of the way, say 'Here's the rough idea,' and 'Can we get back to you on that if you need more?'""</p>
<p>The challenge, organized by the school's <a href=""/cldr"">Center for Leadership Development and Research</a>, also includes communication judges who use different evaluation forms to give students feedback on communication style. One of them is Matt Abrahams who teaches communication electives at the business school. He suggested to one student team that they pay more attention to the alums' body language. If you are presenting to someone who leans forward, he said, verify that he or she is going along with your plan. If another person leans back, try drawing out their objection.</p>
<p>Formally, the Executive Challenge is the culminating event for the first-year-MBA, fall-quarter curriculum. It gives students a chance to practice what they have learned in all their required courses but especially in <em>Leadership Labs</em>, said student Anita Yiu, a former Bain consultant, whose role-play was the last of the day, which gave her plenty of time to worry that she might ""blow up the meeting."" As part of a six-person student squad, she also got a chance to watch her teammates perform earlier role-plays and hear the advice given orally to them by judges afterwards. Second-year students who serve as Arbuckle Leadership Fellows also guided the student squads between role-plays to find larger lessons from the individual feedback, said Sophie Farrell, one of the fellows.</p>
<p>""What's distinctive about this program is that we are not standing up and lecturing them on leadership, and we're not bringing our idea of great leaders in front of them,"" Dean Saloner told the alumni, most of whom graduated before the GSB implemented its current MBA curriculum. ""We are taking them in squads and putting them through exercises that are very carefully chosen and orchestrated with coaches and support staff to help them develop the skills they will need to become change agents. That's what our program is about. That is why this course is so pivotal and why we are so appreciative of your coming and helping us do it.""</p>
<p>The <em>Leadership Labs</em> course is designed to help students answer the question, ""Why should anyone follow <em>you</em>?"" said Professor Larissa Tiedens, senior associate dean for academic affairs and director of the leadership curriculum. It requires a different approach from a leadership course that ask students to analyze other great leaders, she said, and it reinforces the idea that 'to be a great leader, requires being a great learner.'""</p>
<p>The Executive Challenge has become a yearly high point for students and the school as a whole because many staff and faculty are engaged in pulling off the event, Dean Saloner said.</p>
<p>""It is at the core of what we are doing in leadership, at the core of the new curriculum, and at the core of our broader mission of trying to educate a small number of men and women who we think can change the world.""</p>

1,36621,6/17/12 0:00,John Morgridge Addresses 2012 Graduates During Diploma Ceremony,63,news/headlines/commencement-gsb-2012.html,Former Cisco CEO distills his eight decades of life experience into what he called his “Rules for the Long Road.”,113,"<p>""The choices you will make given your youth, your energy, your knowledge, and your experience will change your community, your country, and your world,"" John Morgridge told a group of 473 degree candidates during the Stanford GSB diploma ceremony on Saturday, June 16, at Frost Amphitheater.</p>
<p>The philanthropist and former CEO of Cisco, who received his MBA from Stanford in 1957 but didn't actually attend his own graduation because of the draft, distilled his eight decades of life experience into what he called his ""Rules for the Long Road."" In a series of warm reminiscences, Morgridge explicated eight fundamental principles to help guide the 2012 graduates on their individual life journeys of change.</p>
<p>Among them, he advised students to invest in friendships, set annual mental and physical challenges, learn to give back, and live your values. In his final rule of the day, he advised students to listen, but ""don't always be looking for a new opportunity."" He elaborated that, ""Opportunity is random and may come in many different forms.""</p>
<p>During Morgridge's military service, for example, Eisenhower shifted U.S. defense policy from a tactical to a strategic approach. As a result, the Stanford MBA graduate became the officer in charge of the IBM Documentation Center, which in turn led to a long and fruitful career in the computing industry.</p>
<p>His comments resonated with Dean Garth Saloner's own  observations to the graduates</a>, comments that honestly acknowledged the role that luck plays in our personal success and the obligations it creates.</p>
<p>""For each of us good fortune has played a role,"" he said, ""whether a helping hand along the way, a break on a college admissions decision, being born in the right place at the right time, or countless other reasons that others, with our same talent endowments, are less fortunately positioned. Surely, at least that portion of our success creates an obligation to give back, to share our largesse with others.""</p>
<h2>Degrees Awarded</h2>
<p>The afternoon ceremony honored 384 students who received MBA degrees, 19 PhDs, 67 who earned the Sloan Master of Science degree, and 3 Master of Arts in Business Research degrees. Of the students receiving MBA degrees, 22 also earned degrees in education, 5 earned degrees in law, 1 earned a Humanities and Sciences degree in public policy, and 18 were awarded earth sciences degrees from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.</p>
<p>Jesper Sørensen, the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior, acknowledged the efforts of 76 MBA and 19 Sloan graduates who also received a Public Management Certificate. This certificate is awarded to students who complete a course of study focused on using business and management skills to solve social and environmental issues.</p>
<h2>Students Share Perspectives</h2>
<p>In a new feature of the diploma ceremony, a student representative from the PhD, MBA, and Sloan programs shared their experiences and hopes before the degrees were granted for their cohort. Each individual highlighted the themes of fostering change and giving back.</p>
<p>Sloan student speaker Alex Zakroff fittingly took the GSB art installation ""Ways to Change"" as inspiration for his remarks. This dynamic piece of artwork is comprised of 300 backlit panels that display different adverbs modifying the verb <em>change</em>. ""I challenge you — as well as myself — to be very purposeful in choosing the words that will describe your change,"" he said. ""If you do, my bet is you will leave this world — and this place — better than you found it.""</p>
<p>Bora Keskin from the PhD program put it this way: ""As PhD graduates of the GSB, we are determined to make the world a better place either by highlighting the inefficiencies we see in various industries, organizations, and markets; by building business theories to guide practitioners; or by educating the next generation of executives and entrepreneurs.""</p>
<p>And before the presentation of the MBA diplomas, Ashley Lewis shared her thoughts about change being very close to home. ""We have been given opportunities and experiences that most people only ever dream of ""¦ how do we demonstrate that we were worthy of these extraordinary opportunities?"" she asked. ""We start to change things now, even before we have the power to do the big, important, universe-altering things. How do we do that? We teach people to be good to each other.""</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Every year, a few distinguished students are recognized with awards for outstanding accomplishments. For 2012, the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award was presented to Kevin Diestel. This award is given to a second-year MBA nominated and chosen by their peers as having contributed the most to the fulfillment of the goals of Stanford GSB, in their actions at the school and in society.</p>
<p>The academically highest 10% of the graduating MBA class is designated as Arjay Miller Scholars after Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller, who was on hand during the ceremony to recognize these 38 outstanding achievers. Among the students, one MBA student's academic achievement places him or her at the top of the class, earning the designation as the Henry Ford II Scholar. Christopher Bockman earned this designation for 2012, as well as being the recipient of the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance, which is granted to the MBA student selected by the Finance faculty for achievement in finance courses.</p>

1,80871,6/17/13 0:00,eBay CEO John Donahoe Shares Leadership Insights at 2013 Graduation,67,news/headlines/direction-2013-graduates-leadership-purpose-passion,"Graduation address illuminates four key principles of leadership, including authenticity and a passion for lifelong learning. ",126,"<p>""For me, creating a life and career filled with impact and meaning is about leadership,"" <a href=""/commencement/john-donahoe-remarks"">John Donahoe told a group</a> of 491 degree candidates during the Stanford Graduate School of Business diploma ceremony on Saturday, June 15, at Frost Amphitheater.</p>
<p>The eBay CEO, who received his MBA from Stanford in 1986, elaborated upon four key leadership principles he has learned over the years to help the graduates stay true to themselves throughout their lives and careers. He encouraged his listeners to focus on ""being an authentic, purpose-driven leader, to learning throughout your life, to building character during the tough times, and to having a career <em>and</em> a life that is fully enriching and rewarding.""</p>
<p>These four principles have guided Donahoe throughout his own life and career, which has included turning around an ailing eBay and helping Bain & Company escape bankruptcy. Both experiences were character building in ways that often only come during challenging times, he noted.</p>
<p>As he observed to the graduates, ""In difficult times, you get a sense of who you are, what you're made of, and what's really important to you. It is during the difficult periods that you learn the importance of trust and teamwork. It is during the difficult periods that you learn how to persevere and have faith.""</p>
<p>His comments resonated with <a href=""/commencement/dean-garth-saloner-remarks"">Dean Garth Saloner's own observations</a> to the graduates, as he urged them to have the courage to take on the difficult issues of our day. ""There are big and important challenges, and the world needs change agents who are willing to tackle them with passion and with innovative ideas.""</p>
<p>Dean Saloner also marked the occasion by thanking faculty, staff, and the families of graduating students, as well as recognizing special guests, including Vice President of the United States Joe Biden.</p>
<h2>Degrees Awarded</h2>
<p>The afternoon ceremony honored 389 students who received MBA degrees, 19 PhDs, 80 who earned the Sloan Master of Science degree, and 3 Master of Arts in Business Research degrees. Of the students receiving MBA degrees, 17 also earned degrees in education, 8 earned degrees in law, 2 earned a Humanities and Sciences degree in public policy, and 13 were awarded earth sciences degrees from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.</p>
<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/larissa-tiedens"">Larissa Tiedens</a>, Jonathan B. Lovelace Professor of Organizational Behavior and Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, acknowledged the efforts of 72 MBA and 27 Sloan graduates who also received a <a href=""http://csi.gsb.stanford.edu/mba-public-management-program"">Certificate in Public Management and Social Innovation</a>. This certificate is awarded to students who complete a course of study focused on using business and management skills to solve social and environmental issues.</p>
<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>Every year, a few distinguished students are recognized for their outstanding accomplishments. The academically highest 10% of the graduating MBA class are designated as <a href=""/visit/commencement/certificate-award-recipients"">Arjay Miller Scholars</a> after Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller, who was on hand during the ceremony to recognize these 40 outstanding achievers. Among the students, one MBA student's academic achievement places him or her at the top of the class, earning the designation as the Henry Ford II Scholar. <a href=""/news/headlines/five-stanford-mba-students-designated-2013-siebel-scholars.html"">Stewart Lynn</a> earned this designation for 2013.</p>
<p>For 2013, the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award was presented to Stephanie Collett. Nominated and chosen by her peers, the recipient of this award is the second-year MBA student who — by their active participation, initiative, leadership, and personal integrity — is judged as having contributed most to the fulfillment of the goals of Stanford Graduate School of Business both within school and society.</p>
<p>Finally, Jackson Garton was awarded the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance, which is granted to the MBA student selected by the finance faculty for achievement in and contribution to finance courses.</p>
<p>As the ceremony concluded, Dean Saloner wished all the graduates one final farewell as they took their first step into futures of impact and meaning.</p>",,,303071 | 302646,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Graduates,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/photo-diploma-ceremony-2013.jpg,"491 degree candidates will take their first step into futures of impact and meaning after receiving their diploma at the ceremony held on Saturday, June 15.

1,80161,4/1/13 0:00,Design for Extreme Affordability Addresses Global Poverty,57,news/headlines/duct-tape-empathy-radical-collaboration-tool-kit-changing-world,A class brings together students from across Stanford to create and build products for some of the world's poorest people.,122,"<p>Over the last decade, 325 Stanford students have participated in <a href=""http://extreme.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Design for Extreme Affordability</a>, a five-month-long course in which the students learn to design, prototype, and build products for some of the world's poorest people. The students have worked together in teams, traveled to 14 countries and worked on 80 projects in collaboration with 22 global partners. Among the many success stories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://extreme.stanford.edu/projects/miracle-brace"" target=""_blank"">Miracle Brace</a>, designed for the Miraclefeet Foundation, which is helping to solve a frequent cause of disability in the developing world, clubfoot, through a series of bars and shoes that can be fit to each child from birth until the end of treatment around age 5;</li>
<li><a href=""http://extreme.stanford.edu/projects/dlight"" target=""_blank"">d.light design</a>, which brings solar-powered lanterns to rural households that previously relied on dangerous kerosene; and</li>
<li><a href=""http://extreme.stanford.edu/projects/reframe-tripod-pump"" target=""_blank"">Tripod Pump Frame</a>, designed with and manufactured by Proximity Designs, which makes low-cost irrigation devices to help farmers in rural Myanmar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later this year, PBS is scheduled to air a documentary on the class, produced by filmmaker Ralph King, which will chronicle the lives of students on three teams as they learn to work together in the United States and abroad to build and bring new products to market. The documentary also examines the role the instructors play in helping the students grapple with the many challenges of doing so. Stanford Business caught up with the teaching team during a break from a day spent culling through a record 132 applications for the 40 spots in this year's class, the 10<sup>th</sup> since it began. Here are excerpts of the conversation.</p>
<h2>One of the things you emphasize in this class is collaboration, and that's true among teachers and students. Why is that?</h2>
<p><strong><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/james-m-patell"">Jim Patell</a></strong>: When we started, one of the rules we had was that every course would be taught by at least two faculty members from different departments, and it would not be one of those things where I would do Monday and someone else would do Wednesday. We would both be there for every session. And the d.school was very much intended to be a place with a culture where truly interdisciplinary courses could be taught. But if you want to talk about teamwork, we ought to turn to Julian, because Julian has entered, been drawn into, the course for about five years now, and his role has been explicitly on teams and team building.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://dschool.stanford.edu/bio/julian-gorodsky/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Gorodsky</a></strong>: I'm a member of the founding team of the d.school that built this place and embedded within it a welcoming appreciation for human relationships and what it takes to have a team that really can work well together. Focusing on extreme affordability, we've worked hard with each other and found places of real communication with each other. I think that is part of what we are demonstrating to the students while we're teaching them radical collaboration and design thinking.</p>

<h2>Why is radical collaboration the right model for creating the kinds of products you want?</h2>
<p><strong>Dave Beach</strong>: To focus on the teaching team first: I come from 40 years of history teaching mechanical engineering, and trying to connect design and building together. I've learned from Jim Patell. I've learned from Stuart Coulson. Jim's a professor in the business school; Stuart's an entrepreneur — a very successful, high-tech entrepreneur. When we meet as a group — usually seven people — it's a stimulating and amazing experience. The range of ideas is much greater than I would have if I met with myself or with colleagues in a traditional field — in my case, design. More ideas come out. More excitement comes out.</p>
<p>And the other thing that's wonderful about this collaboration is that there are no titles here. There's no sense of hierarchy. Everyone's ideas are just as good as anybody else's. So, from my perspective, this idea of radical collaboration — I don't know what either of those words really mean. What I know is that this team of teachers has a great time together, and I, personally, am much more creative than I could possibly be doing anything without the team.</p>
<h2>I imagine it can be daunting for a physicist, say, to be put in the same room as a poet and asked to collaborate.</h2>
<p><strong>Sarah Stein Greenberg</strong>: My experience as a student was that as a person with a health care and business background — a nonprofit background — I had never had the occasion to work with engineers before. I had not worked closely with people from the medical school. I had not worked closely with people from all across the Stanford campus. And we don't realize how much you grow up in your own academic discipline until you see that reflected back at you in the different ways that another student operates. That was a profoundly important moment in my own education. And I think there's a belief operating when you're trying to solve these kinds of very messy problems and potentially create something new and powerful. Having more diverse perspectives at the table is going to broaden your array of potential solutions. But getting to the point where you can productively work as a team across so many disciplines is challenging.</p>
<h2>What's the process of making it more comfortable?</h2>
<p><strong>Stuart Coulson</strong>: On the day the students find out what team they are on, I run a business quiz and kind of rapid business research project. The idea is to show that a multidisciplinary team can all contribute to the area of business research for competitive analysis, for understanding the market, and for various other things. It's also a team building exercise because I'm asking you to do an impossible job in a very small amount of time. So, the very first thing they experience, other than the team members, is a pressure situation because by the time we get to the end of class, they're all going to be in a pressure situation to try to finish their project. And it's a certain amount of hype. The idea is to get people excited about their new project, their new task, and to start to understand their new environment.</p>
<p><strong>Beach</strong>: Being surrounded by people from a variety of disciplines generates very high expectations, of course. People understand before they apply that they're going to spend more time — like all their time — on this course. But I think a couple things mediate against you in the sense of fear. I think the first one is that the very first exercise when they walk in the class — the very first hour in the class — is a joint exercise in which everyone is kind of equally able to contribute. And, in fact, at least for the engineers, but I think probably also for others in the class, the idea of going and meeting people that are different from you, and developing empathy, and extracting from that some sense, some point of view about what you might do to be helpful, is something that any sensitive human being can contribute to equally. It's a matter of energy. It's a matter of commitment. But it's not a matter of professional background. So, the most important part of the course is probably not the outcomes, but that whole idea that an important part of your professional life, whether you're a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, a business person, a geologist, is appreciating people and learning how to develop empathy and construct a point of view around that. It's equally available to everybody.</p>
<h2>That word: empathy.</h2>
<p><strong>Gorodsky</strong>: It's empathy for the human factor — empathy for yourself, for example. For me, coming into this work and getting to work with a remarkable team, I frequently feel humble. I've experienced more doubt, more uncertainty — all the things that students talk about. In getting together and working with this team: ""I don't know what he knows. I don't know what she knows."" And you get through that. And you break through that because you're really working collaboratively. That goes on with the students.</p>
<h2>How do you have empathy for someone you've never met and have no experience of in the developing world?</h2>
<p><strong>Stein Greenberg</strong>: Having fresh eyes is an incredibly valuable tool. It's easier to fall into the trap of designing for yourself if you're imagining a user down the road in Mountain View than if you are traveling to a different part of the world. You, and your other teammates, who have totally different perspectives from you, are soaking in every shred of evidence and data that you can, and then you're having an ongoing collaboration with a partner, and testing.</p>
<p><strong>Patell</strong>: On the first day of class students do an exercise where they need to redesign the oral hygiene experience. Its point is to send home the message: ""You're not designing for yourself. People are more different from you than you think they are."" And it takes something mundane, like a wallet or brushing your teeth, where you might think that everybody does it or wants it the same, and they find out that the person standing next to them — literally, who's about the same age, going to the same university, probably similar socio-economic status — is immensely different from them on something as mundane as how you brush your teeth.</p>
<p>The second thing is empathy. One of the things we force our students to do is put together what we call a point of view statement that captures empathy for the ultimate user, as well as a separate one for partner organizations. What are their constraints? What is your partner organization's mission? What promises have they made that they're trying to fulfill through this project of which you are unaware? And it all comes down, I think, to a word we use a lot — at least I use a lot — about being intentional.</p>
<p>Many people's experience of life, and even from when you were a kid, you were put on a baseball team or whatever it was. Well, we're here to play baseball. We're here to design a product. We're here to do whatever. And the team dynamics — the team evolves the way it's going to go. But it's taken as this random variable that has a life of its own, and that you're lucky or unlucky, as opposed to saying that the way your team operates, the way you get along, is malleable. It can be influenced. It can be not entirely managed, but you can be intentional about how this experience unfolds.</p>
<p>It's worth calling a timeout now and then to diagnose where you are, and to be intentional about what you want to do next. And you can influence that flow of human interaction.</p>

1,4124,6/1/08 0:00,Class Project Takes Wing with Proposal for a Colombian Airline,62,news/headlines/airline08.html,Four Sloan classmates are embarking on a nontraditional career path: launching a no-frills airline in Colombia,110,"<p>Some of this spring's Business School graduates are embarking on a nontraditional job search. A four-member team with a dream class project drew up plans to launch a no-frills airline in Colombia. And just to make it really interesting, they intend to promote the new airline through a reality television show developed by ""Ugly Betty"" creator Fernando Gaitan.</p>
<p>The Stanford Graduate School of Business team of Mexican, Japanese, Brazilian, and Filipino nationals already has an idea, a business plan, and a commitment from an experienced former airline CEO. Now all they need is cash — they're estimating more than $20 million — along with numerous government approvals and enough moxie to wrest customers from existing air carriers, notably established market leader Avianca and year-old discount regional airline Easyfly.</p>
<p>The proposed South American airline is the brainchild of Mexican national William Shaw. Before entering the Business School's Sloan Master's Program last year, he was commercial manager at British Airways World Cargo office in San Francisco, the latest in a string of airline jobs he's held ranging from servicing planes to checking in passengers.</p>
<p>The idea began last fall with a conversation between Shaw and Sloan classmate Shingo Kobayashi. Back in his native Japan, Kobayashi had worked in aircraft leasing and sold planes to the Japanese Defense Force.</p>
<p>What drew Shaw and Kobayashi together as project partners? ""We had engaged in a lot of conversations about the airline industry, its downturn, oil prices, all the stuff the airlines are going through,"" Shaw said. ""I was explaining to Shingo that Latin America is the land of opportunity for airlines. Usually you have one existing airline that's been around forever. They charge a very high fare. So, if you live in places like Colombia and Venezuela, your choices for air travel are very limited to airlines that don't provide a great service.""</p>
<p>The pair pulled together a team, and applied for the strategic management course Strategic Management: Evaluating Entrepreneurial Opportunities. Codeveloped and taught by Dennis Rohan, a lecturer in management, that class, with sections taught by four different faculty, is so in demand that students must apply to enroll, and those with the best ideas make it in.</p>
<p>To attract the rest of the team, Shaw put out an email last fall to other business students laying out problems faced by airline passengers in Latin America and inviting them to help create an alternative.</p>
<p>Among the dozen respondents was Rhyan Uy, MBA '08. After working in his native Philippines as a university math instructor, Uy joined his family's chain of optical stores. As a business student, Uy said he wanted to break into the airline industry, ""something I really find sexy."" While he lacked airline industry experience, Shaw said he chose Uy for his abundant energy.</p>
<p>The group also chose Gabriel Migowski, a member of the MBA class sof 2009 originally from Brazil. A former consultant with Bain & Co, he'd authored a major analysis of the Latin America airline market, bringing much aviation industry knowledge to the table.</p>
<p>""We want to grab people with similar but also different backgrounds to get a very engaging and diverse team that will allow us to bring out the best ideas possible,"" Uy explained. Then it was on to complete industry research. Rohan connected the team with a mentor, Scott Bekemeyer, MBA '93. In the mid-1990s, Bekemeyer had helped launch Sierra Express Airlines, a regional carrier based in Oakland. He supplied the team with ideas, and walked them through what it would take to start an airline business.</p>
<p>The team decided to focus on Colombia, intrigued by market research showing the country drew more than one million foreign airline passengers last year and has fairly stable economic and political landscapes. They decided to create a no-frills airline with ticket prices about 20 percent lower than current companies serving the region. To keep costs low, the proposed carrier's fleet would include newer, more fuel-efficient planes, wouldn't offer free meals, would use online booking, and would stick to high-demand travel routes.</p>
<p>Juan Emilio Posada, a former Avianca president and chief executive, has signed on to become chairman of the proposed airline. Shaw would be the company's chief executive, while Kobayashi would be chief financial officer. Uy would handle product development, while Migowski would be vice president of fleet and network operations.</p>
<p>Some team members have already been to Colombia to file the paperwork to charter the company and meet face to face with Posada.</p>
<p>Then, there's the ""Ugly Betty"" connection.</p>
<p>Gaitan, who created the celebrated Colombian telenovella that's now a prime time television phenomenon in the United States, has agreed to write a reality show for Columbian TV about the students' airline startup. He would be creative director for the series, under a deal Shaw said was reached last month with Colombia-based television production firm Vista Productions. Similar to the popular American show ""The Apprentice,"" airline employees, including flight attendants and some entry-level staff, would be selected on the show. Viewers might even vote to choose the airline's name. ""Then you create this massive database of people who are already involved in your airline and want to fly,"" Shaw said.</p>
<p>The day after the final episode of the reality series, plans are for the new Colombian carrier to hold its inaugural flight.</p>
<p>Before all that becomes a reality, of course, there's the matter of raising those millions in startup cash.</p>
<p>""We're at the point where we're starting to look at the capital markets and using the Stanford network to go reach out to possible investors,"" Shaw said.</p>

1,83136,6/2/14 0:00,Three Stanford GSB Faculty Honored by Their Students,52,news/headlines/three-stanford-gsb-faculty-honored-their-students,Students cited faculty members for their dedication and skill at teaching.,74,"<p>Three Stanford GSB faculty members — a former senior White House economic adviser, a new assistant professor of accounting, and an expert in organizational behavior — are being honored by their students for their extraordinary dedication and skill at teaching.</p>
<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/keith-hennessey"">Keith Hennessey</a>, B.A.S. '90, an economics lecturer who served as senior White House economic adviser to President George W. Bush, as well as economic policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, was awarded the 2014 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award. Hennessey received ""an astonishing 49 nominations,"" said selection committee member Brian Rose, who will receive his MBA on June 14. That amounts to about one-third of his students nominating him for the award ""despite the fact that he is notorious for cold-calling, despite the fact that he assigns a heavy workload, and despite the fact that his worldview differs from many of his students'.""</p>
<p>Hennessey, who joined the Stanford GSB faculty in 2009, teaches courses focusing on U.S. fiscal policy, the U.S. financial crisis of 2008, and the European debt crisis of 2011-13. His blog at KeithHennessey.com was named one of the 25 best economics blogs by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Student nominators cited the time and effort that Hennessey puts into his courses, as well as his ability to teach both sides of controversial issues. ""He expects the best from his students, raising the quality of discourse in the classroom and pushing us to challenge our assumptions and think critically about the issues facing our country,"" said one student. ""No conversation in the classroom ever feels canned,"" said another. ""He strives to be original at all times.""</p>
<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/ed-dehaan"">Ed deHaan</a>, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington just last year, before he joined the Stanford faculty as an assistant professor of accounting, was singled out by managers and executives enrolled in the 2014 MSx/Sloan master's program. DeHaan's introductory financial accounting course focuses on the nature, scope, and limitations of accounting information while paying special attention to financial reporting and corporate disclosure strategies. In their nominations, MSx students praised deHaan's after-hours help sessions, as well as his ability to teach students with a wide range of interests. ""He did a great job at making dry subject matter into a fulfilling learning experience,"" said Felipe Ortiz, one of 83 students to graduate from the master's program this year. ""Professor deHaan brought his industry experience to the classroom and kept us updated on recent news involving accounting principles,"" said another student. ""We recognized his expertise in the matter.""</p>
<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/kristin-laurin"">Kristin Laurin</a>, who has been an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford since 2012, received the 2014 Distinguished Faculty Service Award for her work with doctoral students. Laurin's yearlong course, <em>Design and Process of Experimental Research</em>, covers everything from idea and hypothesis generation to study design, analysis, and publication. (Her own research looks at how people's religious beliefs and other ideologies affect their pursuit of long-term goals, and vice versa.)</p>
<p>Students said they were particularly impressed by Laurin's efforts to improve student writing through her own workshop on the subject. ""She never turns down my requests for feedback on research projects,"" one nominator said. Doctoral student Tamar Kreps added her own praise: ""Kristin's generous and constructive advice not only has strengthened our work but also has served as a model for us in our interactions with each other,"" she said. ""Her contagious enthusiasm and desire for all of us to succeed have set a tone of collaboration and exchange that has extended outside of her classroom. Our future colleagues will have a lot to thank her for.""</p>

1,4347,4/19/11 0:00,Stanford GSB Knight Management Center to Achieve Highest Green Level,68,news/headlines/knightsustainability.html,New facility is expected to earn the highest LEED Platinum rating for environmental sustainability from the U.S. Green Building Council.,136,"<p>On April 29, 2011, Stanford Graduate School of Business opens the Knight Management Center, a new facility of eight buildings around three quads designed to support an innovative MBA curriculum put in place in 2007. The center is expected to achieve the highest <a href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222"" target=""_blank"">LEED</a> Platinum<sup>®</sup> rating for environmental sustainability from the U.S. Green Building Council.</p>
<p>""The best buildings in the world derive from a clear sense of what people want them to become,"" said Stan Boles, principal architect for <a href=""http://www.boora.com/"" target=""_blank"">Boora Architects</a>, which also designed four environmentally sustainable buildings in the new Science and Engineering Quad at Stanford. ""We were inspired by the Stanford Graduate School of Business vision for educating the world's future leaders. Innovation and collaboration are paramount.""</p>
<p>Together, the Knight Management Center and the adjacent Schwab Residential Center for MBA students and executive education participants foster interdisciplinary learning and demonstrate the commitment of the Stanford GSB to environmental leadership. Construction of the Knight Management Center further leverages Stanford University President John L. Hennessy's call for the <a href=""http://sustainablestanford.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">university</a> to be a force for change on issues of global importance, especially regarding the environment.</p>
<p>Filled with light and the latest technology, the 360,000-square-foot facility underscores what is taught in many of the Stanford GSB's electives such as Environmental Entrepreneurship and Environmental Science for Managers and Policy Makers, as well as in core classes covering sustainability across the functions of business, and in its MBA/MS Environment and Resources joint degree program.</p>
<p>Green aspects of the building that contribute to its high sustainability rating include:</p>
<h2>Lighting</h2>
<p>The relatively narrow dimensions of the classroom buildings and floor-to-ceiling glass maximize the amount of daylight entering the building, significantly reducing the need for electric lighting. 90% of interior work spaces are illuminated by daylight and room lights turn off automatically when a room is emptied, reducing the electricity load.</p> 
<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>Photovoltaic panels on the roof will generate 500,000 kilowatt hours per year, harvesting enough solar energy to power 12.5% of the complex's energy demand. The Knight Management Center's eight buildings will exceed current state energy standards by 45%. For example, more efficient under-floor air distribution systems replace forced air systems, and air-handling units recapture waste heat and redistribute it where it is needed. During summer months, the building will employ night flushing systems-automated skylights and windows-to release the hot air of day and draw in cool air overnight.</p>
<h2>Water</h2>
<p>The center will use rainwater or re-circulated gray water to reduce potable water usage for sewer conveyance by 80%. Landscape plans were developed with sustainability in mind. </p>
<h2>Open Space and Vegetation</h2>
<p>More than 60 trees were removed from the site, boxed during construction, and then replanted at the center. Wisteria vines climb up the roof-like trellis surrounding the circular Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, allowing for shaded outdoor dining outside. Trees line a path along Knight Way, which draws the rest of the Stanford campus into the business school area. Stanford uses native and drought-tolerant plantings to reduce the need for irrigation. This tradition is continued at the Knight Management Center. Fifty percent of the site is devoted to open space.<p/>
<h2>Building Materials</h2>

<h2>Stanford's Sustainable Master Plan Legacy</h2>
<p>Frederick Law Olmsted's master plan for Stanford University, developed in the late 1800s, set the Main Quad as the dominant feature of the campus. For the 21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond, Stanford has embarked on a mission to build on and restore the original master plan by reinforcing Serra Street as the primary east/west axis for the campus. Placing the Graduate School of Business at the east end of Serra Street, with the School of Medicine at the west end, strengthens the importance of Serra Street as the primary campus link.</p>
<p>This east/west axis is also the ideal orientation for sustainable building design. The Knight Management Center takes advantage of the southern exposure to reduce the need for artificial lighting, while the long north orientation allows the buildings to take advantage of the Mediterranean climate through the use of operable windows providing natural ventilation to many interior spaces.</p>",,,,,,4346,Our Campus | Visit Us,stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus | visit,,,,,,,,,,,KMC,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/sustainability.jpg,The Knight Management Center generates 12% of its energy needs through photovoltaic panels mounted on the roofs of its buildings.,Aerial view of Knight Management Center buildings,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,,,,,,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,81836,11/8/13 0:00,First Graduate Completes Online Stanford Certificate,52,news/headlines/first-graduate-completes-online-stanford-certificate-innovation-entrepreneurship,European product manager is first to graduate from virtual Stanford Certificate Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship.,122,"<p>When French product manager Franck Langevin completed the online <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://create.stanford.edu/index.php"">Stanford Innovation and Entrepreneurship Certificate</a> last month, he did not simply internalize the eight required courses. He also synthesized the learning and shared it with colleagues at his company, Mappy, a 100-person software company in Paris akin to Google Maps. ""I've introduced design thinking in my organization,"" said Langevin. ""This is the fruit of the courses: People like this fresh way of improving product design. We are following the interviewing and prototyping methods laid out in the program.""</p>
<p>Langevin is just the first of several graduates who recently completed the Stanford online certificate. Available to anyone anywhere in the world at any time, the online Stanford Innovation and Entrepreneurship Certificate, which launched in Fall 2012, added its eighth course in September, allowing the earliest participants to complete their certificate in the last month. People may enroll in a single course or earn the professional certificate from Stanford by completing any 8 of 12 courses. Since the program's inception, some 270 individuals have enrolled in at least one of the courses, for which tuition is $995 each. Participants in the program represent 47 countries, with 46% from outside the United States. The largest numbers of participants are from the United States, Brazil, Canada, Spain, India, and Australia. Twenty-five percent are women.</p>
<p>Among the eight courses Langevin took, the ones he remembers as most valuable are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://create.stanford.edu/courses/leading-innovation.php"">Leading Innovation</a>, taught by Professor <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/robert-i-sutton"">Robert Sutton</a>, which focuses on how to build a culture of innovation within an organization, and <a href=""http://create.stanford.edu/courses/empathize-and-prototype.php"" target=""_blank"">Empathize and Prototype: A Hands-On Dive into the Key Tools of Design Thinking</a>, which teaches participants how to develop a deep understanding of product users.</p>
<p>Langevin cites the Leading Innovation course as a source of his motivation to lead ""Make It Day"" at Mappy. This event encourages collaborative idea generation and innovation brainstorming within a 24-hour period. Employees of the company are encouraged to set aside daily tasks and prototype an approach to a problem within the business — anything from a better way to handle invoices to a new product enhancement. Langevin says this event has been embraced by employees as a way to uncover creative solutions within the company, and that they are organizing a second Make It Day this year. ""I learned from Professor Sutton's course that you can't force people to innovate. You need to create a safe environment where they feel trusted, respected, and empowered.""</p>
<p>Recently, Langevin's company has initiated a strategic shift from online mapping and e-commerce to developing incentives for mobile users to go to physical stores to buy products and services. This involves understanding in detail what motivates the consumer, and how he or she shops in order to develop a product that accurately matches the consumer with appropriate new services. Langevin spoke about how the courses in the Stanford Innovation and Entrepreneurship Certificate have influenced the way he and his team have approached users. ""We set out to conduct empathy interviews with users to discover what the real need is, and what we found was a huge learning about how much a comfort zone and temporal factors influence their consumer behavior,"" he said. ""It's a tango between creating the product and developing the market,"" said Langevin. ""I am spending more time doing user research to be sure I am addressing the right need that might lead to a better product.""</p>

1,35316,6/4/12 0:00,2012 Distinguished Faculty Service Awards Honor Teaching Excellence,67,news/headlines/fta-2012.html,"Stanford GSB students recognize Dirk Jenter, Charles Lee, and Jeremy Bulow for their passionate teaching of challenging subjects.",129,"<p>Passionate teachers of challenging subjects transform students. That was the message students in three Stanford business programs sent to the faculty this month by selecting outstanding teachers of the year to honor. In their nominating comments, the students often called out teachers for their passion and willingness to respond to challenging questions from the most expert students, while engaging novices with clarity, flourishes of humor, and worldly examples.</p>
<p>MBA students chose professor Dirk Jenter for his compelling teaching of <em>Managerial Finance</em>, a tough, required course that builds a framework for first-year students.</p>
<p>Master of science students in the Sloan Program honored professor Charles Lee for making accounting compelling to all, including some who had hoped to avoid it. It was the second year in a row that the Sloan students chose Lee as their outstanding professor.</p>
<p>Doctoral students honored a professor less for classroom teaching than for mentoring and advising on a one-on-one basis. They chose economics professor Jeremy Bulow not only for the attention he is willing to give them individually, but also for his role in creating a ""friendly and warm environment."" Bulow is ""always available and provides advice that demonstrates he truly cares about his students' best interests,"" one student wrote. Students also appreciate the thoughtful way he introduces them to other scholars in his vast network. Bulow is famous among doctoral students, one said, for the ""strikingly perceptive and quick way in which his mind works — unusual because he can tell you what 17 cubed is immediately.""</p>
<p>Lee was cited for his commitment and availability, plus his catchy enthusiasm for accounting. ""He makes the boring stuff <strong>really</strong> interesting,"" one student wrote. An expert on fundamental analysis, equity evaluation, behavioral finance, and microstructure, Lee also has won teaching awards at Cornell and the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>MBA students nominated 46 professors and instructors for their teaching award, but Jenter, an associate professor of finance, landed the top honor despite the fact that his required course met at 8am on Mondays and 3pm on Fridays.</p>
<p>A student with finance experience and ""relatively obscure questions"" was impressed that Jenter engaged in ""lengthy and detailed replies back and forth"" via email. Meanwhile, neophytes in the field found his enthusiasm for the material ""infectious"" and enlightening. ""His quotes were inspiring enough to become slogans,"" one added.</p>
<p>Never one to punt a teachable moment, Jenter repeated his key piece of advice at the award ceremony on May 31:</p>
<p>""The most important thing in the world is personal happiness, or your mother, or your dog, or whatever you want it to be,"" he reminded students.</p>
<p>""However, the second most important thing in the world is free cash flow, and if you don't watch your free cash flow very carefully at any point in time, both your mother and I will be deeply disappointed.""</p>

1,4381,6/23/11 0:00,Development Economist Gerald M. Meier Remembered,48,news/headlines/meier_obit_2011.html,"A leading figure in the evolution of development economics who authored books on the subject well into his eighties, Gerald M. Meier has died.",142,"<p>A leading figure in the evolution of development economics who authored books on the subject well into his eighties, Gerald M. Meier, the Konosuke Matsushita Professor of International Economics and Policy Analysis, Emeritus, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, died from complications of a malignant brain tumor at his home on the Stanford campus on June 21. He was 88.</p>
<p>Meier's 1964 text, Leading Issues in Economic Development, now in its eighth edition, has been translated to seven languages and is taught in classrooms around the globe. Well known for his good humor and masterful tan, Meier introduced one of the first economic development courses in the MBA world, and was credited with inspiring generations of students to study the economies of less-developed countries.</p>
<p>Meier taught Stanford business and economics students from 1962 until 2005, long after his formal retirement in 1992. Students praised him for his Socratic teaching method and his ability to stay in contact with them decades after graduation. Fond of the beach, health food, and reggae music, Meier, a Rhodes Scholar, taught at Oxford, Williams, Wesleyan, and Yale before being recruited to Stanford GSB by then-Dean Ernie Arbuckle, who was building the school into an intellectual powerhouse.</p>
<p>""Gerry Meier was a major contributor to the field of development economics with a worldwide reputation,"" said colleague George G.C. Parker, Dean Witter Distinguished Professor of Finance, Emeritus. ""His arrival on the faculty strengthened our international economics curriculum in a major way. Professor Meier was widely traveled and was among the most in-demand leaders of student study trips to the developing world. His enthusiasm for all things international made him a role model for international scholars at the school.""</p>
<p>""An economist is both a trustee of the poor and a guardian of rationality,"" Meier wrote. But the distance between the two remained a chief concern for him. ""As trustee for the poor, the economist respects the values of altruism and economic justice. As guardian of rationality, the economist respects self-interest and efficiency. But does not the future course of development depend in large part on the capacity to combine the seemingly incompatible values of the trustee and the guardian? Can the professional developer combine a warm heart with a cool head?""</p>
<p>Meier authored more than 34 books, and he helped to introduce the field of development economics to U.S. colleges and universities. He lectured frequently at universities in Latin America, Asia, and Western and Eastern Europe. As a consultant to the World Bank, he served on three Bank missions to China.</p>
<p>""Gerry Meier's extensive knowledge of the field and his deep interest in the human aspect of development were evident, and made a huge impression on me, said Dani Rodrik, professor of international political economy at Harvard... His book, <em>Leading Issues in Economic Development</em>, has been the companion of a generation of undergraduates getting their first exposure to the field. It is a masterful book that will not be easily replaced.""</p>
<p>""When my roommates (at Wesleyan University) told me they were taking a seminar from some young assistant professor hot shot on growth and development, I thought I'd join them,"" recalled Jeffrey Williamson, now economics professor at Harvard who then wanted to study art, math, and architecture. ""So, in the fall of 1956, I joined all the economics majors in Gerry's class. One class meeting, and so much for architecture. It's been economics ever since. When I taught economic development at the University of Wisconsin (1963-1983), I used Gerry's Leading Issues in Economic Development.""</p>
<p>Meier also served as a consultant to Stanford Research Institute, National Science Foundation, Emergency Committee for Trade, Brookings Institution, United States AID, Oxford University Press, Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, Overseas Development Council, Overseas Development Institute, International Center for Economic Growth, and Overseas Development Administration (U.K.).</p>
<p>In 2001, Meier co-edited with Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz, then chief economist at the World Bank, a collection of essays by 35 leading development economists, Frontiers of Economic Development: The Future in Perspective (Oxford University Press and The World Bank).</p>
<p>Born in Tacoma, Wash., in 1923, Meier graduated from Reed College in 1947, became a Rhodes Scholar in 1948, studied economics at Oxford, and received a PhD in that field from Harvard in 1953. In 1954 he married Gretl Slote, who survives him. He is also survived by their four sons: David E. Meier, of Boston, Mass.; Daniel R. Meier, of Berkeley, Calif.; Jeremy Meier, of Sacramento, Calif.; and Andrew Meier, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and six grandchildren.</p>
<p>Diagnosed with a brain tumor in January 2003, Meier underwent surgery and extensive treatment. He was able to continue to work, including editing his final book, and travel.</p>
<p>In his book Emerging from Poverty: The Economics That Really Matters, Meier wrote: ""We worry in this book about what can realistically be done to lessen the pain of poverty still suffered daily by two-thirds of humanity. Two centuries after the industrial revolution, only a few countries have become rich, while more than 100 nations are poor."" In the 1984 volume, he wrote of the ""necessary improvements in development policy"" that ""still await more attention by economists.""</p>
<p>""The underdevelopment of economics itself,"" he contended, ""must be overcome if the disappointments are to be overcome.""</p>
<p>Plans for a memorial service are pending. The Gerald M. Meier Book Award, an annual prize to honor excellence in undergraduate economics, has been established at Reed College and University College at Oxford University. Similar awards are being created by the family at Stanford University, and Wesleyan University. Donations may be made to the funds through the family at 774 Santa Ynez, Stanford, Calif. 94305.</p>
<h2>Memories of Gerry</h2>
<p>The same week that I received the GSB News of Professor Gerald M. Meier's death, I learned of the passing of Professor Fazlollah Akbari of IRAN, one of Gerry's first outstanding students at SGSB. I thought some former students of Gerry or other Stanfordites might be interested to learn how it came to be that Gerry was recruited to Stanford and some examples of the very significant impact he had on business education and on actual economic development world wide, most especially in developing nations. So here goes:</p>
<p>In 1960, Dean Ernie Arbuckle persuaded the Ford Foundation to grant SGSB a substantial fund to establish a center for bringing to the School young faculty from developing nations to study a variety of approaches to researching and teaching business administration, as well as to interact with some local managers of Northern California businesses. Thus was born the International Center for the Advancement of Management Education (ICAME). The faculty was drawn both from Stanford and other leading schools of business administration throughout the U.S. Ernie recruited and appointed Professor Ezra Solomon of the University of Chicago as the first Director of ICAME. Interestingly, Ezra himself had come to this country as a Ford Foundation Fellow from Burma many years earlier.</p>
<p>During 1960-1961, an ICAME Center building was constructed, including a discussion style classroom, library, lounge, offices and related facilities. Also, Ezra traveled Latin America and Africa; his Associate Director traveled the Middle East and the Far East developing world countries, both to establish relationships with schools of business, administrative staff colleges and universities, so that each year a young professor from the same institution would travel to Stanford to study a different functional business field under an American faculty noted in that discipline. The returning Fellows were encouraged to join together and, with their school's administration, make appropriate changes in curricula, teaching approaches and interactions with local business. The exceptions to the annual ICAME faculty rotation were Gerry Meier and Ezra Solomon.</p>
<p>The first year's subjects were Financial Management and Control; the second were Marketing and Distribution; and so on. Enclosed is a copy of the Closing Session of that first year's program, including a listing of the Participating Fellows of that first ICAME group. As noted in the program, Professor Fazlollah Akbari, was Chairman of the 1962-63 ICAIVtE Fellows. He returned to Iran to teach Accounting; subsequently he became the Vice Minister of Higher Education for Iran. In 1987-8 he found it necessary to leave Iran and returned to the Stanford campus for about a year to do research and write. He spent 20 years as the leader of a group of academicians creating the first Farsi accounting/management terminology dictionary. Gerry Meier was his inspiration.</p>
<p>You already know of Professor Jose Maria Tejero Garcia, who came to Stanford as a faculty member from the University of Caracas, Venezuela; subsequently, he returned to his homeland, Spain to teach, research and write, especially about Development Economics, inspired by Professor Meier. Another ICAIVIE Fellow, Professor Jaime del Carmen Laya, remained on campus to earn his PhD at Stanford before returning to teach at the University of the Philippines; subsequently, he became Chairman of the Central Bank of the Philippines. Subroto, Professor of Accounting at University of Indonesia, returned to teach initially; then successively, he became Minister of Trade, Oil Minister for Indonesia; and, subsequently for several years, he was Chairman of OPEC.</p>
<p>Several others also held prestigious positions of administration in their country's governments or at one of its universities; a few of the Fellows did not return to their native lands, but stayed in this country or migrated to Canada.</p>
<p>One, non-academic, but very important element of the ICAME program was its community support. A Stanford ICAME faculty wife had the inspiration to form a group of campus and Palo Alto families, each to host an ICAME Fellow. Many Fellows brought their families, some with small children, even babies. Each Fellow/family was: met on arrival at the airport by a host family; conducted to an already furnished apartment in Mountain View; provided orientation to the area; assisted with shopping; and subsequently, all were invited to participate in social events, both small family gatherings, and with the entire group for dinners and entertainment complete with national foods, costumes and entertainment. To this day, some of the Stanford host/ICAME Fellow relationships continue.</p>
<p align=""right""><em>— Leonard ""Ted"" Marks, Jr., former Stanford GSB Faculty</em></p>
<p>""One reason Gerry remained so much a part of the Wesleyan scene was his intense belief in the undergraduate experience. When in 1958 then- President Victor L. Butterfield formulated a new tutorial-based college plan drawing much from Oxford, Gerald Meier became a fervent practitioner and advocate. He believed strongly that you could strengthen learning exponentially by changing the teacher-student relationship. Instead of being a ""professor"" who graded students, Meier committed to being a ""tutor"" in a collegial pursuit of learning not enslaved to grades. I was one of 15 classmates in the first year of the College of Social Studies. We started to get the difference when Meier insisted we, humble sophomores all, call him Gerry. We admire him today. And though I doubt the collegial bond he shared with us had much to do with the immense learning he continued amass, it had an enduring impact on us.</p>
<p>And as one of his early baby-sitters, I can affirm he was an exemplary family person. Compassion with rationality: he lived it. ""</p>
<p align=""right""><em>— John Driscoll, College of Social Studies, Wesleyan University</p>
<p>""Gerald Meier was an important influence in my early thoughts of an international career with private capital, real estate, and investment companies which came to fruition during my career with companies based in the USA, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. I am confident that his wisdom and kindness were significant in the development of scores of young minds during his career, for which we are all appreciative.""</p>
<p align=""right""><em>— Robert Boyd, MBA '71</p>
<p>""Gerry was a warm and approachable professor; he taught gently and with great respect for development. Then, he was the consummate professional with the growing band of his ex-students. We all became collaborators. The world thanks him.""</p>
<p align=""right""><em>—Paul Guenette, MBA '85</p>
<p>Gerry's classes were a highlight of the GSB experience. I have export-led development etched in my brain.</p>
<p align=""right""><em>— David Kohls, MBA '85</p>
<p>Gerry was a wonderful teacher, clearly presenting theory and contemporary cases ... but also carefully listening to the student to determine where he/she was with it. If need be, he could then build the intellectual bridge for them to cross, to reach his point. I will remember him with respect.</p>

<p>These participants — from California, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Oregon, and Pennsylvania — were from high-performing teams that took part in <a href=""http://online.stanford.edu/course/rauh-finance"" target=""_blank"">The Finance of Retirement and Pensions</a>, an open online course created and led by Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/joshua-d-rauh"">Joshua Rauh</a>. The event was co-hosted by the <a href=""http://www.hoover.org/"" target=""_blank"">Hoover Institution</a>, which paid for travel-related expenses to allow a representative from each team to come to Stanford for the event.</p>
<p>""People are more responsible for preparing for their own retirement than ever before, and I believe the class has given participants the knowledge to make better financial decisions for themselves and also to be more informed participants in public policy debates,"" said Rauh.</p>
<p>Chief among the public policy debates that concern Rauh are those relating to public sector pensions, to which he dedicated the second half of the course, including the livestreamed, on-campus symposium. During the event, he elaborated that underfunded public pension systems ""are threatening to eat away at the governments' ability to provide vital public services,"" among other dangers. His concern was clearly shared by the course participants, a majority of whom indicated in a survey that they are worried about the impact of government budget problems on their taxes and on municipal and state governments' ability to fulfill their obligations.</p>
<p>Six teams were chosen to present at the symposium based on the course's final project, an analysis of a state or local pension system that covers public employees, including policy recommendations about how to improve those plans. The winning proposals were selected through a rigorous process as having the most promising ideas to address trillions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities that are threatening the financial future of U.S. state and local governments.</p>
<p>The proposals addressed challenges faced by the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS); Cook County Pension Fund, Illinois; Police and Fire Pension Fund, Jacksonville, Florida; Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS); State of Oregon Public Employees Retirement System; and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System.</p>
<p>While there were some significant differences among the recommendations brought forward, many of the participants proposed adjustments to the retirement age, the conversion of defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans (or the creation of hybrid plans), reductions in money management fees, changes to the investment mix, and adjustments to the discount rates used to calculate future streams of income.</p>
<p>A panel of Stanford pension and finance experts was on hand during the symposium to discuss the public pension crisis and the merits of the various proposals. The panelists supported many of the recommendations, while noting the practical realities of political reform. As Stanford lecturer and president of Govern for California <a href=""http://siepr.stanford.edu/peopleprofile/3075"" target=""_blank"">David Crane</a> observed, there were many innovative ideas brought to light, but a fundamental issue is motivation for change. ""This pension problem can continue for a long time without anybody doing anything,"" he said. ""We need to come up with a clever way to motivate people to make change happen."" Otherwise, it ""will clobber the next generation.""</p>
<h2>Top Pension Reform Proposals</h2>
<h3>California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS)</h3>
<p>With over $170 billion in assets and 860,000 current employees or retirees linked to CalSTRS, the system is the nation's second-largest public pension fund. The key operational reform recommended by the symposium team was a voluntary buyout of pension liabilities via a lump-sum payment to current employees, thereby reducing their future benefits and improving the system's finances. The team also recommended a fundamental structural reform that would eliminate the defined benefit plan and transition it to a hybrid defined benefit/defined contribution plan for all future employees, while extending the retirement age in a phased manner.</p>
<h3>Cook County Pension Fund, Illinois</h3>
<p>This five-person team reverse-engineered the cash flows of the pension fund and estimated its unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) to be $9.4 billion. After running simulations that tested how different measures would help reduce unfunded liabilities over the next 100 years, the team recommended an optimal combination of measurements that included some benefit reductions (increased retirement age, reduced cost of living adjustments, changes to pensionable salary, and discontinuation of healthcare), as well as changes in the annual required contribution calculation that would guarantee the solvency of the fund in the long term.</p>
<h3>Police and Fire Pension Fund, Jacksonville, Florida</h3>
<p>This four-person team analyzed the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund, which is only 39% funded, and has an unfunded liability of $1.7 billion that has grown over 13 times since 2000. The team has proposed a comprehensive package of reforms, with the cornerstone being a ""Freeze & 40"" policy that would freeze the current defined benefit pension system and replace it with a robust, portable, and immediately vesting defined contribution plan for current employees. In addition, the team recommended changes to the current paradigm of fixed cost-of-living benefit adjustments and large reductions in fund investment management expense fees.</p>
<h3>Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS)</h3>
<p>This top team analyzed the Mississippi PERS and recommended a constitutional amendment that would require the PERS Board to invest its funds only in index funds, stable value funds, and cash or cash equivalents, a step the team believes would save nearly 1% of net assets annually; revert benefit accrual rates, employee contribution rates, and cost of living adjustments to those that were in place prior to 1999; increase the normal retirement age to 62 and base final earnings on a 4-year average; and require the legislature to bring public employee salaries up to the average levels of the contiguous states (which are about 26% and 14% higher for non-teaching and teaching positions, respectively).</p>
<h3>State of Oregon Public Employees Retirement System</h3>
<p>The Oregon PERS system has an unfunded liability of $11 billion that is unsustainable, according to the team that analyzed it. The team proposed reforms that would result in savings of $3.35 billion, including capping the maximum retiree benefit to 90% of final annual salary (FAS); disallowing vacation and sick pay to be calculated as part of FAS; and requiring 10 years of service for cost of living adjustment eligibility. To generate income, the team recommended modifying current legislation to eliminate selected tax refunds until the UAAL reaches zero. They also proposed long-term reforms such as adjusting the investment mix from 75% equity to a more balanced portfolio and changing the discount rate from 8% to 6%.</p>
<h3>Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS)</h3>
<p>The Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System serves over 600,000 individuals and is 66.4% funded, with a UAAL of $29.5 billion. The team focused on legislative, funding, performance, and investing trends beginning in 2001 to understand the source of the UAAL, and developed recommendations to reduce or eliminate it through changes to PSERS' governance, risk strategy, reporting, revenue generation, fees, and plan features. Some specific proposals include the introduction of a natural gas fracking tax and the appointment of a chief risk officer. Team members have recently shared their findings with school districts, state and federal legislators, and PSERS officials.</p>
<p>With these many proposals on the table, Joshua Rauh concluded the symposium with the observation that ""pressure to make changes comes when people feel the squeeze on services"" and the hope that all of the course participants will continue to think about how to effect change within their state and local governments.</p>

1,36681,6/16/12 0:00,"Graduation Speech by John Morgridge, MBA '57",44,news/headlines/morgridge-transcript-2012.html,The full transcript of the keynote speech given at the 2012 Stanford GSB diploma ceremony.,53,"<p><em>The following is a transcript of the graduation address given by alumni speaker John Morgridge.</em></p>
<p>Thank you Dean Saloner for your kind introduction. My grandchildren who are present might believe all of it but my wife, Tashia, also present, would be sure to edit it.</p>
<p>Class of 2012, it is an honor to be part of your graduation. 57 years ago, I graduated from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I did not attend commencement as we were off to Lackland Air Force Base for pre-flight training as a Second Lieutenant. Decades of war — WWII, Korea, and Vietnam resulted in a program called the draft and everyone was requested to serve. However, I doubt my classmates who attended remember if we had a commencement speaker let alone what was said. With that in mind, I will be brief and offer some observations from eight decades of life's journey — which I refer to as ""Rules for the Long Road."" They are not new or necessarily original.</p>
<h2>Enjoy and Live Fully Each Stage of Life</h2>
<p>Don't hurry! Marriage/First Job/Start up/Children/Grandchildren/ Retirement/Post-employment opportunities. College and graduate school were a wonderful time of life for me and my very best friend, Tashia, as I am sure it has been for many of you. Try to find that same fulfillment in your jobs. You will spend Â¼ of your life working. The Myers-Briggs test said I should have a goal of becoming the president of a company. It was not until I was 54 years old that I became president of a failing lap top company, GRID, courtesy of a business friend I had worked for at Honeywell. It is a hard title to get unless you start your own company or thank Dad when you get it.</p>
<h2>Invest in Friendships (and a Good Marriage)</h2>
<p>Start now — friendships are not free — cards, calls, gatherings, emails, Facebook, tweets. It takes time but pays life long dividends. Long relationships do not just happen, they require personal investment over time, but they are the essence of a life fully lived. I still duck hunt every year with high school and college friends who took geology professor Doc Loudon's no credit weekend Wisconsin Duck hunting course back in the 50's. As a special favor to your folks, marry early and start a family. Grandchildren are the wonderful gift your parents get for raising you. To our delight, five of our grandchildren are in college — one here at Stanford, one at UC Berkeley and one at our Alma mater, the University of Wisconsin - Madison. They often come and sometimes even cook dinner for us.</p>
<h2>Set Annual Mental and Physical Challenges</h2>
<p>Be curious — stay hungry — learning is the work of a lifetime. I loved my work as a computer salesman because it let me ask lots of questions and learn about many different businesses. Fifteen years ago I started teaching a course on entrepreneurship here at the GSB. It is indeed a wonderful mental challenge to prepare for and teach 60+ young adults like you twice a week. Stay physically active — start now and when you are 50, 60, 70, you will have the bodies to keep up with your desires. Our outlet has been bicycling. In the past 20 years we have ridden our bikes across Wisconsin, New York, and Missouri; around Lake Michigan; to many of the Civil War battlefields; from San Francisco to Chicago and across the United States; from our home in Portola Valley to our home in Holderness New Hampshire — 70 days, 4,400 miles, and lots of Super 8s. Tashia insisted we ""credit card,"" not camp. Jogging in our forties and fifties gave us the stamina to do that. Five years ago we hiked the Long Trail, a 300-mile south/north journey in the Green Mountains of Vermont — 77 mountains, 19 gaps, 30 days. Our trail name was ""The Old People,"" given us by our grandson.</p>
<h2>Learn to Forgive — Both Others and Yourself</h2>
<p>Mistakes are a part of life.</p>
<p>Make amends and move on.</p>
<p>Don't carry baggage — it weighs both you and your friends down.</p>
<h2>Make Sure That What You Want to be is What You Want to do</h2>
<p>As a senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison I took a series of pre-law courses. While the title of lawyer was appealing to my mother, the actual work was not that interesting to me. Many individual contributors, engineers, architects, teachers, researchers long for management jobs, not realizing that these are people jobs, not technical jobs. Hiring — Reviewing — Terminating.</p>
<p>We spend a quarter or more of our life working. Make sure it is more than just a living. Make sure it is a life — an interest — a passion. You are blessed with an endless list of work options. Take the risks to find the one that is fulfilling for you and a challenge you want to take on.</p>
<h2>Learn to Give Back</h2>
<p>The graduates of the GSB have a wonderful tradition of giving back. The new campus is a testament to that. Seek ways to give back — with time, talent, and treasure. Make sure you develop the art of small check giving. Our first check to the Stanford was for $10.00 in 1967. In recent years we have added a few zeros. We are fortunate people. It is our need and responsibility to help our fellow man.</p>
<h2>Live Your Values</h2>
<p>They will be tested both in good times and bad. Hold on to them. Make them part of who you are.</p>
<h2>Listen — But Don't Always be Looking for a New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Remember opportunity is random and may come in many different forms. Sometimes it comes in the form of a disappointment. The challenge is to be ready and recognize it when it appears.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1955 I received my rejection letter from Harvard Business School, and as a result we came to Palo Alto — not Boston. Some 50 years later I fully appreciate how lucky that was.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1957 Eisenhower shifted our defense policy from tactical to strategic and instead of flying an F86 around Europe I ended up flying a desk at the 1607 Air Terminal Squadron at Dover Delaware.</p>
<p>Because I had an MBA, I became the officer in charge of the IBM Documentation Center. My IBM salesman took me to lunch as I was departing the Air Force two years later and whispered across the table, ""It's computers my son."" While only a few years my senior, he was right. His advice and Moore's Law provided over 40 years of excellent opportunities as I went from main frames to minicomputers to PCs. In 1988, we sold the GRID laptop business to a large electronics retailer for $150 million. Truth be told, it was more of a business dream than a going concern. It is hard to compete when you buy most of your products parts from your competitors. Based on my minicomputer and PC experience, my gut intuition told me that the next BIG THING was the networking of all the world's computers. That fall I became president and 39<sup>th</sup> employee of a East Palo Alto startup building a multi-protocol router designed to do just that. It was call Cisco.</p>
<h2>Your Challenge</h2>
<p>It is, unfortunately, true that our generation and that of your parents have left you with lots of major challenges that will now be yours to address. Wars, budget challenges, pollution, global warming, cuts to education, battles over health care, natural disasters. The list goes on.</p>
<h2>Are you ready?</h2>
<p>You are a privileged few who have earned an MBA from Stanford University. You live in an amazing country that at the moment is politically divided. Will you add to this divide or help to bridge the gap? The choices you will make given your youth, your energy, your knowledge and your experience will change your community, your country and your world. Your involvement will make a difference.</p>
<h2>A Last Thought — Stay foolish</h2>
<p>Ride across the country at 63 — foolish said our children. When we arrived in Missoula, Montana they knew we would make it. Better in the doing than the telling.</p>
<p>Hike the Long Trail in Vermont at 73. Better in the telling than the doing — we had a lot of rain!</p>
<p>So today you will graduate from the Stanford Graduate School of Business! Well done! Let's give them a hand.</p>
<h2>Remember</h2>
<p>Be curious = stay foolish</p>
<p>I have always wished that for myself.</p>
<p>Now as you set out on this new phase of your life, I wish that for you!</p>
<p>Congratulations, good luck, and thanks for listening!</p>",,,309651,,,,,,,,,,,2012 Commencement,http://youtu.be/_g112RL1ncM,,,,Morgridge,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/Morgridge%202.jpg,John Morgridge,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,Career & Success,,,,MBA,,,,,Katie Pandes
1,4431,2/1/10 0:00,Classmates Heap Praise on Rainwater,35,news/headlines/rainwater_10.html,"Richard Rainwater toasted as ""the legendary financier of our generation"" at GSB Alumni Association's 2010 Arbuckle Award gathering.",131,"<p>Richard Rainwater's MBA classmates and friends of more than 40 years gathered on a cool February night to toast the man one called ""the legendary financier of our generation"" as the Stanford GSB Alumni Association named Rainwater the 2010 recipient of its Arbuckle Award.</p>
<p>""The Arbuckle award is designed to inspire people by example, and I think Richard's example inspires all of us,"" said Garin Staglin, one of numerous members of the MBA Class of 1968 who heaped accolades on Rainwater, a man who developed his love for finance and investing as a young Texan attending the business school on a scholarship.</p>
<p>His undergraduate studies at University of Texas, Austin, were in mathematics and physics, but Rainwater credited his brother with inspiring him into his broad business career. ""My brother said, 'Don't be mediocre at anything; be remarkable at something.'""</p>
<p>""For the balance of his career no one knew who Richard was,"" said classmate John Scully, who joined in painting a picture of a man who excelled equally at spotting economic opportunities and talented individuals to take advantage of them. ""He has an extraordinary ability to judge people and the genius to let them go,"" said Scully, quoting Rainwater as saying: 'We like you, we like the deal, now run with it.'</p>
<p>""You've been a people person and taken great care of everyone who worked with you,"" said Scully. ""What created that sense?"" Rainwater replied simply: ""My mother.""</p>
<p>Another classmate, Randy Chappel, noted that Rainwater has ""a way of making people believe they could do things they didn't know they could do, and then go out and do it."" But Rainwater's sense of fun is equally memorable to his classmates. ""He has a sense of whimsy and enjoyment about what he's doing,"" said another classmate, Jim Bartlett, whether it's setting up a bowling alley in a corporate office or hosting business lunches at taco stands in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>From 1970 to July 1986, Rainwater served as the chief investment advisor to the Bass family, whose overall wealth increased dramatically during his tenure. He then founded ENSCO International Incorporated, an oil field service and offshore drilling company. Rainwater began purchasing Texas real estate in 1990, and in 1994 formed Crescent Real Estate Equities, Inc. He had spotted the growing demand for energy.</p>
<p>""You're able to see things 3, 5, 10 years before other people do,"" said classmate Reece Duca. In the mid '80s, said Duca, Rainwater watched the fall of the Berlin wall and growing market demand in Eastern Europe and told him: ""The world is changing and a lot of people in these new markets are like the people in the class of '68. They're going to build wealth, and their actions are going to impact the demand for energy."" Ken Hersh, MBA '68, recalled Rainwater telling him: ""Whenever there is chaos, there is opportunity. When everyone is running away, there's opportunity — there's got to be a nugget in there somewhere.""</p>
<p>In introducing Rainwater at a dinner held on the Stanford campus, business school Dean Emeritus Robert Joss recalled how the Texan got him fired up to build the Knight Management Center, now under construction. In August 2007 Joss recalled Rainwater challenging him: ""Tell me what is the most important thing I can do for you — and think big.""</p>
<p>""Two days later I sent him a big proposal,"" said Joss, ""and four days after that he gave me the go ahead for what became the Rainwater challenge — a $50 million commitment to the new campus if we could raise an additional $50 million."" The school raised $60 million.</p>
<p>During his two years in the MBA Program, ""Stanford became everything to me, my heart and soul,"" said Rainwater revealing deep emotions. ""That's why I contributed so much to the school. I want no accolades. I did it out of deep feeling."" The MBA class of 1968 proudly and frequently calls itself The Greatest Class Ever. Rainwater added to the class's aura.</p>
<p>One of the seven buildings in the new Knight Management Center due for completion early next year will be known as The Class of 1968 Building.</p>",,,,,,,Past Arbuckle Award Recipients,http://alumni.gsb.stanford.edu/events/arbuckle,,,,,,Art of the Deal,http://youtu.be/B3UkH6eOMgc,,,,Rainwater,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/rainwater-richard.jpg,Richard Rainwater,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,,,,Crescent Real Estate Equities,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,4197,9/1/11 0:00,Class Taught by Real World Crisis Managers,42,news/headlines/crisis_class.html,Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and British Labour Party member David Miliband teaching Crisis Management on the World Stage class.,147,"<p>On Monday, they debated solutions to the Euro crisis. On Tuesday, devising strategies to bring peace to Afghanistan was the goal. On Wednesday, discussions centered on patent protection of vital medicines versus the developing world's public health needs. Thursday's talks examined different approaches to combating terrorism.</p>
<p>And finally, on Friday, the 30 MBAs enrolled in the special Crisis Management on the World Stage class at the Stanford Graduate School of Business focused on the upswell of democracy movements sweeping through Syria and other Arab nations. Their professors were two diplomatic heavyweights — Britain's David Miliband and Stanford's Condoleezza Rice.</p>
<p>Miliband, a British Labour Party member, became Britain's youngest Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in three decades when he served from 2007 to 2010. Rice, who was U.S. Secretary of State from 2005 to 2009, is now the Denning Professor in Global Business and the Economy at Stanford GSB and a faculty director of the school's Center for Global Business and the Economy. The two led students through an examination of international challenges they faced together as their nations' top diplomats, including issues involving in both international politics and the global economy.</p>
<p>Miliband, 46, said he wanted the class to stimulate students' thinking and ""make them realize that politics is part of economics, and if you want to be a business leader, you've got to understand politics and political risk.""</p>
<p>While he came to the business school to co-teach the course, Miliband said he also enjoyed the opportunity to learn about how the U.S. is wrestling with its own dilemmas. And, he said, discussing complicated issues with Rice definitely kept him on his toes: ""You can't help it if you have a conversation or debate with Condoleezza Rice, you will sharpen your own arguments.""</p>
<p>Shortly before heading back to England, Miliband discussed teaching the course and a variety of topics during a Sept. 22 talk sponsored by the global center. In a conversation with Ken Shotts, professor of political economics at Stanford GSB, Miliband tackled topics ranging from Britain's pursuit of clean tech, and why there is diminished support for Al-Qaeda in the Muslim world to what sparked him to create a leadership training academy, <a href=""http://www.movementforchange.org.uk"" target=""_blank"">Movement for Change</a>.</p>
<p>Terrorist network Al-Qaeda has been weakened by efforts from Western governments as well as its own actions, said Miliband. He cited Al-Qaeda's bombing of a wedding in Jordan in 2005, which killed 52 Jordanian Muslims. Afterwards, ""you saw a precipitous fall for support of violent extremism across the Muslim world,"" Miliband said. ""I think you've seen a decay in which Al-Qaeda has been significantly degraded, but also in which millions of Muslims around the world have embraced political Islam, rather than global jihad, as a way to further their interests. From my point of view, the embrace of political Islam is a good thing.""</p>
<p>Even with the bankruptcy of Bay Area solar company Solyndra, Miliband urged MBA students to pursue clean tech, just as Britain continues its ambitious clean tech goals. As Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Miliband pioneered the world's first legally binding emissions reductions bill. The Climate Change Act of 2008 mandates that the U.K. reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. The law was supported across the political spectrum, a crucial element of its success. Miliband said: ""There's no point in regulating for two or three years and then another government comes in and turns it over. That's the importance of cross-party consensus.""</p>
<p>While some business books say that vision is a leader's most important trait, Miliband disagrees. Passion, he says, is critical. ""Unless you have a passion for what you are doing, you will never be able to lead,"" he said. ""If you've got a vision written down, but people don't see it in your eyes, you won't lead. If you haven't got passion, you'll never be able to inspire.""</p>
<p>As examples, two recent British leaders, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his successor, Gordon Brown, both had passion, Miliband explained — Blair for modernizing Britain, and Brown for making a difference in the developing world.</p>
<p>However, superior persuasive skills ultimately made Blair the more successful leader, he said. ""Tony was a better synthesizer, and he was a better educator and explainer,"" he said. ""In a way, Gordon had a tougher task because it's very hard to follow someone who's a very good leader.""</p>
<p>Helping develop Britain's new generation of leadership is the goal of Movement for Change, the community organizing group established by Miliband last year with the goal of mobilizing 10,000 community leaders throughout the country during the next 4 years to drive improvements in education, health, and other areas citizens deem important. ""The best solutions involve the government as leader, public and private sector organizations as innovators, and the people mobilized. That's how you change things,"" he said.</p>
<p>The idea for Miliband and Rice to co-teach a business school class came about during a dinner Rice held in the British official's honor when he was passing through San Francisco earlier this year. The school's dean, Garth Saloner, another guest, supported the idea.</p>
<p>They jointly decided to give students an introduction to a range of public policy, foreign policy, and diplomacy issues, settling on a curriculum covering terrorism, trade, war, politics, and finance. During each day's three-hour class, students held a simulated negotiation after hearing an introduction to the topic with insights from Rice and Miliband.</p>
<p>Students wanted up-close stories about the former diplomat's experiences, Miliband wrote in a <a href=""http://davidmiliband.net/2011/09/crisis-management-on-the-global-stage"">blog post</a>, ""but they also wanted to understand why the multinational system doesn't work, whether values can really play a role, how America positions (and mispositions) itself, how the rising powers will engage.""</p>
<p>Susan O'Malley, MBA '12, said she took the class because it was a unique opportunity to learn from two people ""who shaped history, to hear their stories firsthand and their anecdotes and perspectives."" She called Miliband ""a phenomenal communicator in terms of his charisma, passion, and enthusiasm for the issues.""</p>
<p>Another student, Drew DeWalt, MBA '12, said the simulated negotiations from the class showed him why it's so hard for political groups to reach consensus.</p>
<p>""Everybody's got different interests involved that they want to protect,"" said DeWalt. ""You realize it really is hard to make progress.""</p>

1,4034,6/1/10 0:00,2010 South Africa Study Trip: Powerful Lessons,46,news/headlines/2010SouthAfrica.html,Students offer observations on their study trip over spring break to learn as much about education in South Africa as the nation itself.,136,"<p>When I boarded the plane for my 47-hour journey to South Africa, I honestly did not know what to expect. I was hoping to be inspired by the country's optimism and the ability of its people to succeed, despite the crushing odds. I was worried that the trip would be emotionally challenging, and I would spend the time angry and frustrated by the inequality and social problems that we would see.</p>
<p>The theme of our trip was education. Over spring break, 20 first-year Stanford Graduate School of Business MBAs traveled to this complex nation, along with student leaders Karla Gallardo and Daniella Raffo, both MBA '10; Sarah Soule, the Morgridge Professor of Organizational Behavior; and Melanie Lowenberg of the business school's Public Management Program. We all set out to learn as much as we could about education in South Africa while educating ourselves about the nation itself.</p>
<p>Our first meeting was with Kim Porteus of the Mandela Institute, part of the prestigious University of the Witwatersrand. Recognizing that we were fresh off the plane, she gave us a broad overview of politics and culture in South Africa, and insight into how the apartheid era continues to shape society. One of the biggest problems she identified with the education system is the way in which it teaches English, one of the country's 11 official languages. English is the language of political and economic success. But children, particularly those living in rural areas who speak a different first language, need to be taught some rudimentary English before they can even receive official instruction in English. That's a reality the current education system does not handle well.</p>
<p>We also visited several different schools, all outstanding in their own way. The students at the African Leadership Academy, founded by Stanford GSB alums Fred Swaniker, MBA '04, and Chris Bradford, MBA '06, were incredibly impressive. The school is modeled on Stanford GSB; In addition to providing a first-rate academic experience for students from across the continent, the academy gives students the opportunity to start their own businesses and lead community service projects. These students are smart, driven, and perceptive. If they do become leaders, Africa will be in safe hands.</p>
<p>LEAP School in Langa, a racially segregated township just outside of Capetown, was a great contrast to the academy. Students attending the LEAP School come from neighboring townships, where life is often hard. They, too, were smart and motivated. Although focused on math and science — two subjects that had been omitted from black students' curriculum during apartheid — the ""life orientation"" lessons seems to be the school's core strength. Founder John Gilmour explained that in a country where 25% of the adult population is HIV-infected and one-third of women have been raped, learning how to become responsible adults is hugely important.</p>
<p>While in South Africa we were not just visiting schools. We spent a night at the Honeywell Game Lodge sleeping in luxury tents and going on safari rides where we spotted lions, elephants, rhinos, leopards, and buffalos. In Utah province, a rural area in the East Cape, we played an energetic game of football with the local boys, and were relieved to find that the condoms littering the area had been used only to hold up the boys' socks. Thanks to our great leaders there were no traumatic moments, but there were many unforgettable memories.</p>
<p>Although we saw poverty during our South Africa trip, we also saw resilience and hope, and huge amounts of talent. The country may not quite be living up to its Rainbow Nation promise yet. However, if the energy we saw can be harnessed, South Africa could easily be one of the continent's biggest success stories.</p>

1,4081,4/29/11 0:00,Knight Management Center Open For Business,42,news/headlines/KnightopeningApril29.html,The new home for the Stanford Graduate School of Business opened its doors April 29 with a dedication and open house that drew thousands.,137,"<p>Stanford Graduate School of Business christened its new home, the Knight Management Center, at a lively April 29 celebration that began with a formal dedication ceremony and later let loose as a flash mob, and the Stanford Marching Band descended on the school's new town square. The event marked the end of a three-year building project that produced a facility that will enable the business school to move forward and grow in the areas of curriculum and innovation.</p>
<p>""We're now able to turn the physical spaces that have been created here into intellectual learning places,"" Graduate School of Business Dean Garth Saloner said of the 8 new buildings on the 12.5-acre site.</p>
<p>Six hundred banners bearing words and phrases meant to inspire change, written by members of the GSB and Stanford communities, flowed from the new buildings. The banners echoed the business school's slogan: Change lives. Change organizations. Change the world. Visitors also had the chance to contribute their words of change on banners that <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stanford-Graduate-School-of-Business/208357009185713"">can be seen online</a> and will be displayed in the future.</p>
<p>Stanford President John Hennessy thanked the donors, many of whom were present at the dedication ceremony, for the new center, ""which is not only a gift for students today, who have already fallen in love with the place, but a gift for students of the future.""</p>
<p>Philip H. Knight, who earned his MBA at the school in 1962 and for whom the Knight Management Center is named, said that in the coming decade the school will redefine management. ""People come up to Penny [his wife] and me to thank us for making this possible,"" Knight said. ""I tell them it is an honor for us to be associated with a special institution.""</p>
<p>Knight wrote his business plan for Nike in a small business class at the school taught by the late Professor Frank Shallenberger.</p>
<p>Thousands of visitors, alumni, and members of the Stanford community toured the 8 buildings after the dedication ceremony and had the opportunity to see some of the 100 classrooms of various sizes that enable teaching a new curriculum in flexible learning spaces.</p>
<p>As visitors enjoyed the Stanford Gospel Choir and Mendicants a capella group, they had the chance to sample locally grown foods at the Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, coffee specialties from the TA Associates CafÃ©, and appetizers from Schwab Residential Center dining services. The crowd also sampled the terraces, patios, and shaded picnic benches, which are designed as spaces to meet, share a meal or cup of coffee, and think collaboratively.</p>
<p>The firm Hit and Run T-Shirts helped guests of the open house customize T-shirts bearing messages of change, while some visitors took self-guided tours of the 360,000-square-foot facility using cell phones to call in and learn about specific locations and features of the buildings.</p>
<p>The green features of the sustainably designed center, which is seeking a <a href=""http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222"">LEED</a> Platinum® rating for environmental sustainability from the U.S. Green Building Council, were visible during the open house, including the roof-mounted photovoltaic panels; the long, narrow buildings that allow more natural light in; and the 870-space underground parking structure that eliminates the ""heat-island effect"" of traditional uncovered parking lots.</p>
<p>Visitors also had the chance to view the public art pieces dedicated to change, such as the cornerstone that reads: ""Dedicated to the things that haven't happened yet and the people who are about to dream them up"" or the Monument to Change as it Changes, a wall composed of panels that constantly change color, creating constant movement and different patterns.</p>
<p>And they could stand in Phil Knight's footsteps.

1,4464,10/1/90 0:00,Professor William Sharpe Shares Nobel Prize for Economics,57,news/headlines/sharpe_nobel.shtml,"Sharpe named for his Capital Asset Pricing Model, an aid to making  investment decisions.",89,"<p>William F. Sharpe, Timken professor emeritus of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, today was named winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize for Economics for his work in developing models to aid investment decisions.</p>
<p>Sharpe shared the award with Harry Markowitz of the City University of New York, and Merton Miller of the University of Chicago. The award was the seventh time in 10 years the Nobel economics prize has gone to Americans.</p>
<p>Sharpe, 56, is the ninth Nobel laureate on the Stanford faculty and the first member of the Graduate School of Business faculty to win the award. Five other laureates are affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford.</p>
<p>Sharpe, in Tucson, Ariz., for a meeting of the Institute for Quantitative Research in Finance, called the award ""almost impossible to comprehend.""</p>
<p>He was informed of the honor by a 3 a.m. telephone call from the Swedish Academy of Science. He went to the meeting to apologize for not being able to attend but before he could say anything, the 110-person session stood and applauded.</p>
<p>They asked if he could stay for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>""Then they brought in the champagne,"" he said.</p>
<p>All three winners work in both the theoretical and practical world of corporate and investment finance.</p>
<p>""Each of the three gave one building block"" to the financial market theory, said Assar Lindbeck of the Swedish Academy of Science, which announced the award from Stockholm.</p>
<p>""The theory would have been incomplete if one of them had been missing. Together they created a complete picture of theory for the financial market which has had great importance in research and education,"" Lindbeck said.</p>
<p>Sharpe's theory, called the Capital Asset Pricing Model, is a way of matching potential gain from an investment with the potential risk. The theory is based on the earlier work of Markowitz, who with Sharpe derived theory from Stanford's Kenneth Arrow, winner of the 1972 Nobel in economics.</p>
<p>Sharpe's model is considered the standard for the investment industry and is used by corporate, institutional, and pension fund managers to plan and judge their investments.</p>
<p>Arrow said the theory is a ""way of approaching a dynamic economy, that is, an economy that changes over time. It balances the present and the expectations of the future, measures gain versus security.</p>
<p>""It has become absolutely standard in the security market,"" Arrow added.</p>
<p>The model, Sharpe told the news conference in Tucson, ""is a statement""¦or assertion that securities with large amounts of market risk should be priced so that in the long run you should expect to do better, make higher returns by holding them. Basically, the more market risk you take the greater should be your expected long-run return.""</p>
<p>For example, Sharpe's model was used to predict the return on investments for a portfolio that avoided companies with ties to South Africa. Common wisdom held that divestiture of such stocks would almost surely mean losses in investment potential. But according to Sharpe, even when the costs of divesting are included, a South-Africa-free portfolio could outperform one with those companies included.</p>
<p>His model also makes it possible to judge a portfolio's performance by the amount of risk inherent in such investments. It helps managers decide when potential return is worth the risks of the investment.</p>
<p>Sharpe also is the author of a major college textbook called Investments (Prentice Hall).</p>
<p>Sharpe said he was particularly happy to share the award with Markowitz. ""We're old and very close friends,"" he said. ""He was basically my mentor. He so richly deserved it, as did Miller of course.""</p>
<p>He said he did not know what he would do with his share of the $700,000 prize. ""We have just not had a chance to think that through,"" he said. ""The honor is so great that it kind of dwarfs the money, although God knows, it's a large amount of money; I don't want to demean the money by any way, shape or form.""</p>
<p>Back at Stanford, his colleagues were nearly as excited.</p>
<p>John Roberts, Jonathan B. Lovelace Professor of economics at the Business School, called the award ""wonderful."" ""Bill is a superb researcher, not only concerned with the theoretical content but is extremely concerned with its implementation in the real world. On top of that, he's a super teacher.</p>
<p>""His work is used all the time in practical finances, by corporations, investment banks and investment services.""</p>
<p>A. Michael Spence, dean of the Business School, said that ""all of Bill's colleagues around the country and the world are very excited and pleased by this recognition: The Capital Asset Pricing Model and its applications are a major innovation, or enduring practical and theoretical significance. No aspect of finance has been unaffected by Bill's work.</p>
<p>""The Nobel Prize is a wonderful recognition of his creativity and insight. It is also gratifying that this recognition should come to a person who has been a gifted and dedicated teacher for all of his academic career.""</p>
<p>""It's really good that the work in finance pioneered by Ken Arrow many decades ago, is receiving the attention it deserves,"" said James Rosse, Stanford's provost. ""There has been great improvement in the way the capital markets work as a result of Bill's research. Bill Sharpe is one of the most deserving human beings I know,"" Rosse said.</p>
<p>Sharpe, a native of Cambridge, Mass., received all three of his degrees from the University of California in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>He arrived at the Business School in 1970 as a professor of finance after having previously taught at the University of Washington and U.C. Irvine.</p>
<p>He retired to emeritus status last year.</p>
<p>Sharpe is president of William F. Sharpe Associates, a consulting company and lives in Los Altos, Calif.</p>
<p>He has written six books, authored numerous scholarly papers and is past president of the American Finance Association.</p>",,,302581 | 302561 | 302626,Book,312101,4464,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sharpe,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/sharpe_1990_199x214.jpg,William F.

1,5228,12/17/11 0:00,Executive Challenge: Bringing the Boardroom into the Classroom,62,news/headlines/executive_challenge_2011.html,Stanford MBA students face off with alumni in day-long simulation designed to test their ability to deal with real-world business issues.,137,"<p>""Bigger! Faster! Stronger! Smarter than before!""</p>
<p>With that rallying cry, nearly 400 scrubbed and suited MBA students left the Schwab Residential Center on Dec. 7 and strode more or less confidently across the street to the Knight Management Center. The occasion was the sixth annual Executive Challenge, an intensive day-long business simulation designed to test the first-year business students' budding leadership skills.</p>
<p>On hand to greet them were more than 200 volunteer alumni judges, many of them seasoned presidents, partners, and C-level executives who had taken days off work and traveled long distances to be there. Dean Garth Saloner marveled at the size of this year's turnout. ""This is the community in action,"" he observed proudly in his opening remarks, addressing the judges gathered in CEMEX Auditorium. ""Our alumni are coming back to support what we're doing academically ... The students have looked forward to it all quarter. They're anxious, keen, eager, nervous, the whole mix. It's become an iconic event.""</p>
<p>Jim Phills, professor of organizational behavior (teaching) and one of the organizers of the day-long program, agreed. ""You are the crucible,"" he told the assembled judges. ""We are going to throw the students in to you, and they are going to come out transformed — stronger, faster, and smarter. They will be the better for their experience.""</p>
<p>Stanford GSB began staging the Executive Challenge in 2007 as part of a major overhaul of its MBA curriculum. Among the changes was a new cornerstone course called <em>Strategic Leadership</em>, which immersed students from the get-go in realistic workplace simulations. The approach, Saloner said, ""was predicated on the fact that you learn by doing as opposed to being lectured at from the front of the hall.""</p>
<p>In this year's exercise, six-student squads — each mentored by a second-year MBA student — were presented with three fictitious business scenarios. One involved a potentially valuable but risky business acquisition, another dealt with product-performance issues, and the third involved an unruly management team. Within the space of an hour, the squads had divided into three groups of two, with each pair quickly studying and presenting one of the cases.</p>
<p>As the first round commenced, MBA '13 classmates Katie Weisner and Dan Stanko launched into their assigned roles as chairman and CEO of the company that was considering an acquisition. Their goal was to convince four skeptical alumni ""board members"" that the deal was sound. Observing from the back of room C110 were their Squad 20 teammates and 1 leadership fellow, a communications coach charged with giving feedback on matters such as body language and vocalization, and additional alumni judges charged with grading the general presentation.</p>
<p>Despite some spirited theatricality on the part of the judges — ""I'm concerned that we're overpaying,"" one fictitious board member warned while another said flatly, ""We should stay out of it!"" — Weisner left the room confident that she and her partner had made their points. ""I definitely thought it was a worthwhile experience,"" she said later. ""The feedback we got was just the right mix of encouragement and really pointed actionable advice.""</p>
<p>Not far away, first-year students Ammanuel Zegeye and Vivek Viswanathan were playing out their roles as the CEO and CTO of a company whose new product was falling short of expectations. They needed to reach consensus with their directors about what course of action to take — and it wasn't pretty. Afterwards one of the judges advised Zegeye, who has an English accent, to speak more slowly. ""We had a lot of conflict with the board,"" he acknowledged, ""but in general I think Vivek and I really complimented each other and worked well together.""</p>
<p>For Jimmy Zhou, MBA '13, of China, the role-playing exercise provided a useful lesson in American corporate politics. He, too, worked on the acquisition case, playing the role of chairman of the board. ""I walked into the room in full support of my CEO, but after our presentation one of the judges said to me, 'If you are the chairman, you usually keep a distance from the CEO; you need to step back a little bit.' That's one thing that really struck me. I didn't realize that."" The event, he added, ""was the highlight of my whole semester.""</p>
<p>First-year students weren't the only ones who found the elaborate role-playing exercise worthwhile. ""I find it fascinating to engage with the students. It reminds me of the thrills and spills when I was going through similar issues,"" said volunteer judge Robin Richards Donohoe, MBA '94, managing director of the San Francisco-based Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation. ""It's energizing to be around all these great students. You remember how pivotal business school was in your own life.""</p>
<p>Dave Whorton, MBA '97, founding partner of Tugboat Ventures in Palo Alto, said he enjoys the day so much that he's been coming back to judge for the past three years. ""I was skeptical at first and figured it would be fairly routine, maybe something I'd do once. But I was so impressed watching the students quickly understand the material, and very quickly present themselves in a stressful situation. It's hard to divine people's character. To see how they behave under stress is very powerful.""</p>
<p>Like many alumni judges, Whorton has found the Executive Challenge to be a good opportunity to network as well. Each year he picks at least two students from the squads he has judged and schedules lunch with them. ""One is now coming into my office regularly on weekends and brainstorming business ideas,"" he said. ""These students demonstrate such strong leadership capability, I want to see them succeed.""</p>
<p>This year's Executive Challenge served as the final fall quarter exercise for the Business School's <em>Strategic Leadership</em> course. Teams that received the highest scores from judges were recognized at the end of the day, but Phills declined to bill the exercise as a competition. ""This day is really about getting the most out of a transformative learning experience — and, on that score, everyone here is a winner,"" he said.</p>

1,82291,2/18/2014 0:00:00,A Group of Sociologists Launch a New Online Journal,51,news/headlines/group-sociologists-launch-new-online-journal,Their goal: to speed the flow of research results and open access to ideas and knowledge.,89,"<p>When she was in graduate school in the early 1990s, <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/sarah-soule"">Sarah Soule</a> joked with fellow students that it took longer to publish a research paper than to gestate a human baby. From the time a research paper was submitted to a peer-reviewed journal until it was published, a year or more passed. The process that seemed so long back then has grown even longer now. Sociologists routinely report that their papers are stuck in the review process for two or three years, says Soule, now a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>Soule is among seven prominent sociologists at major universities who hope to disrupt the way academic publishing is done in their field by launching a new online journal, <a href=""http://www.sociologicalscience.com/journal-information/"" target=""_blank"">Sociological Science</a>, on Tuesday, Feb. 18. The academic editors, headed by chief editor <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/jesper-b-sorensen"">Jesper Sørensen</a>, also a Stanford GSB professor, promise to give authors an up or down decision within 30 days and to publish an accepted research paper within a few months. The journal will be free for everyone to read online.</p>
<p>The long publishing window for existing journals is a problem for two reasons, Sørensen says. It slows down both science production and the use of results.</p>
<p>Study findings can't help policymakers, business leaders, and others make decisions if the findings aren't in the public domain. A study in the first issue, for example, might be useful to education policymakers because it locates where the greatest barriers are to more women preparing for science and engineering careers. Another paper discusses how workweek leisure time affects the unemployed, and two others indicate that online social networking may have less impact than some have thought on promoting real-world changes such as social activism and interracial dating.</p>
<p>Besides getting research into the public domain faster, the founding group hopes to speed up science and make it easier for more young scholars to have an impact. That's important because publish-or-perish is still the byword for doctoral students and junior faculty, but those who hope to earn tenure can easily face critical review milestones with no publications to show because of the lengthening journal publishing process, Sørensen and Soule say.</p>
<p>On the new journal's website, the editors write that for most other sociology journals, ""reviewers — who have little if any accountability to the journal or the author — can wield enormous influence over both the fate and content of papers. This practice has led to a bias toward errors of omission, to multiple rounds of revisions, and to ever-increasing review times.""</p>
<p>Adds Soule: ""My feeling is the more access we have to ideas and knowledge, the better our own work is going to be, and the better able we will be to critique it and think about it.""</p>
<p>The sociologists who launched this journal are among scholars in a variety of disciplines who are rethinking how to critique and disseminate research. In fact, there are a number of open-access journals online, some of which began because scientists in a particular field felt the journal publishing process was too slow or too expensive, while others were motivated by wanting to broaden the access to research.</p>
<p>Reading journal articles has ordinarily required an expensive journal subscription or access to a research library that has one. In recent years, some U.S. federal agencies that fund research have begun to require that papers be made available without payment within a year of journal publication. The American Sociological Association, which publishes a number of journals, has been among those organizations lobbying against such a requirement. In a 2012 <a href=""http://orgtheory.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/open_access_hillsman.pdf"" target=""_blank"">letter</a> to the White House, the organization's executive officer, Sally Hillsman, argued that the organization needs the subscription revenue to carry out the review and publication process.</p>
<p>At least from the tone of discussions about the new journal on popular social science blogs such as Orgtheory, Scatterplot, Whatisthewhat, Crookedtimber, some researchers, although not all, will be happy to forgo the advice from multiple review rounds. ""We're living with 19<sup>th</sup>-century journals. I hope this shakes things up,"" one wrote, while others complained that some of today's reviewers write more pages or critiques than the articles they are reviewing.</p>
<p>Soule agrees: ""I had one a while ago that took three years to review. While I was happy to see it published, I think about all the wasted time and articles that weren't published because of the time spent on it. That's not the way to advance science.""</p>

1,80251,4/3/13 0:00,Students Experiment with Entrepreneurship at Stanford Venture Studio,68,news/headlines/students-experiment-entrepreneurship-stanford-venture-studio,"Graduate students from around Stanford use this dedicated space to try out start-up business ideas, and learn from them.",120,"<p>Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are well known for building companies out of a garage or, more recently, at cafés, where they might nurse a cup of coffee for hours while cranking on their startups. But nearly three dozen teams of aspiring entrepreneurs are now pursuing new ventures out of the new <a href=""/ces/students/venture-studio"">Stanford Venture Studio</a> at Stanford GSB. Among them: Danny Donado, who hopes to launch a cloud-based decision-making tool called <a href=""http://bipsync.com/"" target=""_blank"">BipSync</a> for professional investors; Bastiaan Janmaat, who has created <a href=""https://www.datafox.co/"">DataFox</a>, which aims to be the first Bloomberg for private company data; and Lusi Fang, whose company <a href=""http://www.4soils.com/#home"" target=""_blank"">4Soils</a> builds Bible story-based apps for children.</p>
<p>The studio was launched in June to give graduate students throughout the university a dedicated, around-the-clock place to practice the entrepreneurship concepts and skills they learn in the classroom and work elbow-to-elbow with fellow entrepreneurs, says Aileen Sweeney, associate director at the Stanford GSB's <a href=""/ces"">Center for Entrepreneurial Studies</a>, which manages the studio. The studio provides a residency program, workshops, advising, and community events to support entrepreneurial students' success. ""We don't ask for equity or fees for services. Our interest is purely educational,"" she says. It ""is a safe place to experiment, take risks — even fail. This makes our graduates better equipped to build sustainable ventures that create high impact in the world.""</p>
<p>For the budding entrepreneurs, access to the space means opportunities to collaborate on projects, and to talk with colleagues facing similar challenges. Sweeney says people starting a company encounter a lot of unknowns and don't often have a clear path to follow. ""Working in isolation, often at home, can exacerbate an entrepreneur's challenges,"" she says. ""At the Venture Studio, students can turn to their neighbors and say, 'Hey, I don't really know where to go from here — do you have any thoughts?'""</p>
<p>Janmaat, a Class of 2013 MBA student, says he found the collaborative aspect to be particularly helpful. ""For instance, if you have to put together a presentation for a potential investor,"" he says, ""it's great when the team across from you is working on their own pitch deck. You don't have to reinvent the wheel.""</p>
<p>In his case, the collaboration even changed the direction of the startup. He began a company with the idea that people should be able to experience different jobs by shadowing others for a few hours before committing to a career. But after pitching and sharing concepts with others at the studio, his team realized that idea was far too complicated. ""We learned it's very hard to build a marketplace if you're not starting with a narrow group of users,"" he says. So the company switched gears and now focuses on providing in-depth data on private companies to equip investors, advisors, and others in need of business intelligence to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>Similarly, Donado, also a class of 2013 MBA student, working on a startup called BipSync, says the space gave his team ""an office to come to — a place to leave our notes on the whiteboard and prepare to take some risks."" They also found community. ""Our studio space is next to RentLingo,"" says Donado, referring to another startup. ""We exchange ideas and talk about highs and lows. It's really therapeutic because life in a startup can get lonely.""</p>
<p>In this spirit, the studio welcomes all Stanford graduate students in order to create a multidisciplinary environment that fosters great ideas and creative problem solving. The result? Business students are working with engineering, computer science, and law students on solutions that range from flash sales for green products to election transparency.</p>
<p>The studio also provides a context to apply classroom lessons to real-life situations. One of Donado's classes discussed ways to confirm that a product is actually meeting a need. Talk turned to the value of getting a letter of intent (LOI) signed by a potential customer to demonstrate traction to investors. ""We ran with that idea,"" Donado says, ""and ultimately got an LOI signed by a company that will pay for the beta development costs. It's been a great validation for us.""</p>
<p>""It's unbelievably complementary,"" says Janmaat, ""to be sitting in class where the topic is sales for startups and get some real-life tips from a guy who worked for <a href=""http://www.groupon.com/"" target=""_blank"">Groupon</a> early on and had to sell to hundreds of small businesses; then I run up to the studio and follow his advice in my own sales calls to prospective customers.""</p>
<p>The space also supplements classroom learning with weekly group discussions with experienced entrepreneurs, advising sessions with legal and finance professionals, skills-sharing workshops, and practice pitch sessions. ""Some of the best guest speakers are often young entrepreneurs just a few years ahead of us,"" Fang says. ""I learned a lot about how to optimize SEO [search engine optimization] for my website, which proved really helpful to us.""</p>
<p>Any one of the teams practicing there could build the next big thing. But equally important, the space to build offers students a taste of the realities of life as an entrepreneur. ""As the daughter of Chinese-American immigrants, I grew up thinking an entrepreneur was someone who opened a dry cleaning store,"" says Fang. Fang is now working on her consumer internet venture at the studio.</p>
<p>Through the studio, she says, ""I discovered my passion; I've thrived as an entrepreneur; and now I can't imagine doing anything else. I'm living my dream.""</p>

1,4230,4/1/11 0:00,Leadership Challenges Face Alums Coping with Japan's Disaster,61,news/headlines/earthquake_reaction2011.html,Alumni based in Japan find unexpected obstacles as entire industries face disruption and an unknown future since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.,149,"<p>Since a devastating earthquake occurred off the northeastern coast of Japan on March 11, the leadership abilities of many Japanese business executives are being tested. Among them are graduates of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. About 650 Stanford GSB alums are members of the Japan alumni chapter.</p>
<p>""Almost each and every one of us is trying our best to overcome this very difficult time,"" Akira Yoshida, MBA '99, of Tokyo, wrote in a brief email on April 6. He reported that chapter president Kazuhiko Toyama, MBA '92, and his business colleagues were busy shuttling buses to areas without other forms of transportation. Daisuke Kan, MBA '07, who manages a beverage company called Cheerio, was sending thousands of bottles of sodas to people who did not have anything to drink. Kenji Tateiwa, MBA '04, a project manager for Tokyo Electric Power Company who is also trained as a nuclear engineer, is ""working very hard to control contaminated nuclear plants,"" Yoshida said.</p>
<p>Yoshida also suggested that <em>Stanford Business</em> magazine encourage alums to share information about the challenges they are facing now or about their past disaster leadership experiences elsewhere. ""I am sure that it will give the broader Stanford GSB community chances to think of ways to taking part in helping. I, for one, look forward to seeing it online,"" he wrote.</p>
<p>Here is the first detailed account provided by Shige Yamaji, MBA '93, who lives part time in the San Francisco Bay Area but who was in Tokyo at the time of the earthquake. His startup company works with farming and fishing families in the region hardest hit by the quake, tsunami, and nuclear plant crisis that followed.</p>
<p>""I am truly hoping this earthquake and tsunami will not tie these farming and fishing people's hands and prevent them from the positive changes that they had already started to make,"" he writes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Earthquake Sickness in Tokyo and Aftershocks for Aging Rural Food Producers</h2> 
<p>Japanese culture calls for extremely prudent and reserved communication upon a disaster like this. Perhaps more so than other cultures because we have a fairly reserved culture to begin with. Giving full respect to such cultural context, however, I would like to shed some light for others from the GSB on the situation in Japan.</p>
<p>First, my deepest condolences go to those who lost their loved ones, and sympathy to those hurt and/or affected. My family was fortunate enough to be in the Bay Area and not directly affected; and none of my relatives or friends in Japan was lost by the disaster. I recently arrived in the Bay Areafrom Tokyo to join my family for my kids' spring recess and to work thereafter for about a month with my team in the U.S. subsidiary of the venture I started up in Japan.</p>
<p>When the earthquake hit at 2:45 pm on March 11, I was on the 39<sup>th</sup> floor of a 42-story, 4-year-old building close to Tokyo Bay in Minato-ku of downtown Tokyo. While I was not injured, the shakeup was so massive, lasting about 10 minutes, I thought the building would collapse. It's beyond my imagination how frightful the shake may have been for those who went through this in the Eastern Tohoku Region and Ibaraki Prefecture, areas that had the biggest shake.</p>
<p>As I regained my regular thought process after the quake and started to try connecting to my wife in the Bay Area, the second quake hit Japan at 3:15 p.m. This second one (as well as the third one that hit Shizuoka later in the evening) was a different earthquake from the first one, i.e., not an aftershock of the first one. We in Tokyo felt the second one harder than the first, although the magnitude at the seismic center of the first one was larger. This is because the seismic center of the second one was much closer to Tokyo than that of the first one, which centered offshore of Sendai of Northeast Japan.</p>
<p>Our building management had shut down both the elevator and the emergency stairs because it was not safe to be on either of them during numerous aftershocks. It was not until around 6 p.m. that we were allowed to use the stairs. It didn't take too much time for everyone to make it down to the ground level. I think we were all agreeing that we needed to move before the next potential big one.</p>
<p>At ground level, public transportation had halted. Both landline and mobile phone networks were dead with over-capacity call volume. Virtually no call was successfully connecting until the next day. Mobile service was virtually dead for an additional couple of days.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, most working and non-working people who were not at home when the earthquake hit decided to head home on foot to possibly confirm whether their families were safe. Many working people had to walk 6-7 hours to reach their home, which normally is less than a 1-hour train commute. After dark, taxi stands had long lines of people, perhaps for the first time since the Japanese bubble economy. Bicycle shops were flooded with people searching for a bike to ride home. So were the shoe stores with working women trying to change from high heels to casual shoes to walk a long way home. The situation, however, was by no means chaotic. As seen on CNN, people were orderly forming lines and patiently waiting an amazing amount of time for their turn.</p>
<p>Tokyo is about 150 miles away from Fukushima Power Plant. People in Tokyo seemed calm trying to attend to business as usual, while closely watching the progress of the effort by TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the plant) and international aid teams. The press conferences by the government and TEPCO have been abundant but so far lacked the necessary organization and depth to allow us to fairly assess the magnitude of the emerging problem.</p>
<p>The prevalent common health problem in Tokyo has been ""Earthquake Sickness,"" which is like motion sickness. Symptoms include headache and feeling the earth is shaking when it's not. Some of my colleagues in the office are getting medication for this. Nearly four weeks after the initial quake, people are still feeling it, perhaps because there are still sizeable aftershocks every day.</p>
<p>Women seem to be more affected than men — three out of three women in our office are suffering from earthquake sickness, while none of the 18 men are. (This could be what Japanese call Bushido, or atendency to endure hardship without mentioning it.) The women in Tokyo with earthquake sickness say they can't lie back and rest at home when the people in Tohoku have gone through a life-or-death traumatic experience.</p>
<p>My venture, called Flora Holdings, is experiencing some challenges related to the disasters. We have three operation companies, two in Japan and one in the United States, and provide a membership-based social-commerce platform for Japanese senior citizens on both analog and digital ends. Members can buy and sell products, as well as make friends, using our customized tablet PCs or they can meet, sell, and buy through 120 local Fukiya clubs that also host recreational programs for seniors. Fukiya is a blowgun sport involving deep breathing and mental concentration that is gaining popularity among Japan's senior citizens partly for its health benefits. Japan is the leading aging society, with people over the age of 55 accounting for more than 35% of the population and the highest life expectancy among all countries. The products sold on the platform are mainly food products. Some of our member merchants providing produce for the platform have had their business base wiped out by the tsunami. These include oyster beds near the fishing village of Miyagi Prefecture and a rice farm near the sea in Iwate Prefecture, the two hardest hit prefectures. The great news, however, is that none of our merchants lost their lives.</p>
<p>We are now discussing ways to help these merchants get back to their fishing and farming business, but it has been difficult at best with all civilization lost in the area. In fact, we were able to reconnect with them just recently, more than two weeks after the quake, as there has been no means to contact them with the mobile network in the area dead and the landline service base wiped away. To make the situation worse, the nuclear radiation and contamination damage to agriculture and fisheries cannot be assessed by anyone at this time.</p>
<p>Some people say the Tohoku region or Northeastern Japan accounted for over 60% of agricultural and fishery production of Japan. It is understandable, yet disappointing, that many countries have already decided to ban the import of Japanese produce for health-safety precaution. These are the same countries that, up till a few weeks ago, had been paying twice Japanese domestic market price to get their hands on what had been regarded as the safest and most reliable produce in the world.</p>
<p>The Japanese government is being of no help to the industry either. They announced prematurely that radioactive substances were detected from some produce in the areas hundreds of miles away from Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. Most green leafy vegetables and some other agricultural products from north of Tokyo are being returned to the growers now because the people in Tokyo are shying away from consuming these vegetables since the government made the announcement.</p>
<p>Another issue these produce suppliers must cope with is related to the labor force. Due to Japan's hiked wage level, the fishing villages and the farms for the most part have not been able to afford the younger generation to stay in the village to succeed their traditional businesses anymore. It has become customary for these youngsters to go work for companies in Tokyo. Their parents had to seek a young labor force from outside Japan and started to employ trainees from China based on the internship program agreed to by Japanese and Chinese governments.</p>
<p>As a result of the quake, the people in the fishing and farming villages had to not only terminate these trainees but also fly them back to China, as their families back in China reportedly demanded to the Chinese government that their children quickly be moved out of Japan. These trainees were mostly from fishing and farming villages of China. They would have brought back the latest farming- and fishing-related technology and know-how from Japan, should they have completed the 3-to-6-year internship. For the Japanese fishing and farming communities, if they get a second chance, they will have virtually only the seniors in their 60s, 70s, and even 80s to do the hard work.</p>
<p>Many adjustments most certainly lie ahead. Some of you have asked me about how you can help. It is wise to make donations through the Red Cross or similar established international organizations. Any new independent effort to raise donations is honorable yet can be difficult to execute given the limited access to the disaster areas.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support for the cross-border aid being extended to Japan.</p><p>By Shige Yamaji, MBA '93</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yamaji,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/all/images/Yamaji_3.jpg,"Shige Yamaji, MBA '93",Shige Yamaji,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Leadership,Asia-Pacific,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,81151,7/31/13 0:00,Stanford Program Teaches Innovators Business and Leadership Skills,66,news/headlines/big-ideas-stanford-program-teaches-innovators-business-leadership-skills,Participants in Stanford Ignite learn how to move their innovative ideas forward.,81,"<p>In a recent workshop at Stanford Graduate School of Business, groups of students clustered around tables littered with Post-It notes, pencils, iPhones, pieces of string, cuts of cardboard and the occasional screwdriver.</p>
<p>As they tinkered, they talked.</p>
<p><em>Do you like your bathroom? Is your toothbrush easily within reach? Do you use mouthwash? Is it important to have your toothpaste and toothbrush on the counter, or would you rather have them hidden away?</em></p>
<p>The assignment was to create a better oral hygiene experience. The students were charged with interviewing their classmates, creating a prototype and presenting it to the class.</p>
<p>The workshop in design thinking was part of a program at Stanford GSB called <a href=""/programs/stanford-ignite"">Stanford Ignite</a>, which teaches core management skills and entrepreneurship to technical professionals and graduate students focused on subjects other than business.</p>
<p>The part-time certificate program was introduced in 2011 at Stanford, and is now expanding to several innovation hubs around the globe. Next month, it will start in Bangalore, and in the fall, it will be offered in Paris. There are plans for another program in Beijing next year.</p>
<p>The goal is to provide participants with fundamental business skills such as accounting, finance, marketing, strategy and operations and functional skills such as leadership, negotiation, teamwork and communications.</p>
<h2>Practical Approach</h2>
<p>Stanford GSB started the program as another way to support the practical application of innovative ideas. The first summer program was for Stanford graduate students in the sciences and medicine who had great ideas but no business know-how to help bring their innovations to market.</p>
<p>Stanford faculty members lead Ignite instruction, and the experience is hands-on and immersive — intended to replicate what working professionals or graduate students at Stanford would get.</p>
<p>Investors, executives, legal experts and other guests lecture and mentor the participants.</p>
<p>""It's demanding and challenging,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/yossi-feinberg"">Yossi Feinberg</a>, Ignite's faculty director. ""The gap between what they know coming in and what they leave with is huge. It's just incredible to see the transformation.""</p>
<p>The non-degree program lasts nine weeks and meets in the evenings and weekends, depending on the location. There have been about 60-70 students at a time in each program. A four-week, full-time program is also offered at Stanford in the summer for Stanford-affiliated participants.</p>
<p>While the students do not have business training, they are interested in starting a venture, growing an existing one, or leading and consulting. The projects pursued during the educational program are not expected to be developed to the point of securing funding.</p>
<p>""We're teaching them all the skills they need,"" Feinberg said. ""But it's not only about catching the big fish. Great if they do, but they simply — or not so simply — need to first learn to fish.""</p>
<p>Some students have gone on to create their own businesses. Among the ventures founded by Stanford Ignite participants are DailyDeal, Lytro, Parallel Earth, Piqora and Bell Biosystems.</p>
<p>""The program serves as a nice reality check,"" Feinberg said. ""They sometimes come in with ideas they think will work but they just don't, once we put them to the test.""</p>
<h2>Problem Solvers</h2>
<p>Ignite alumnus Raj Lal, a Silicon Valley software engineer, said the program changed his perspective about starting a business.</p>
<p>""There's a lot more to it than having a great idea, making an app, selling it and getting rich,"" he said. ""Sure, that works for some people, obviously, and it becomes a big story and everyone thinks that's the formula for success. But it's not reality for most people, not for 99 percent of the people.""</p>
<p>Lal said the program taught him the importance of teamwork and about filling a void. ""You start with a problem that you're trying to solve,"" he said. ""Basically, you find out what the customer wants, then build according to that. Don't build something, then try to find customers.""</p>
<p>Lal and fellow Ignite alumni Cynthia Lee and Wendy Soon were inspired during the program to get together to create their own joint venture. The trio created a start-up called <a href=""http://vorkspace.com/"" target=""_blank"">Vorkspace</a>, a platform to help people who work in different locations to communicate and work more effectively as a team.</p>
<p>Soon said she entered the program wanting business skills but not necessarily to start her own venture.</p>
<p>""I thought if I had ideas, someone else would eventually make the product. I'm not capable of doing that,"" she said. ""But the course gave me encouragement and motivation.""</p>
<p>She said the program also gave her the resources and confidence she needed to try entrepreneurship, and provided connections to like-minded people. She, Lal and Lee continue to meet with Ignite alumni at monthly networking events.</p>
<p>""The program was really inspiring,"" said Lee, who received a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford. ""I learned so much I can't believe it was only nine weeks. It felt like nine months.""</p>

1,4439,3/1/08 0:00,Miriam Rivera Elected Stanford Trustee; Receives 2008 Porras Award,67,news/headlines/rivera_hbsa08.html,"Miriam Rivera, MBA/JD ’95, was elected to the Stanford University Board of Trustees a week after she received the Jerry I. Porras Award.",136,"<p>Miriam Rivera's mother had only a third-grade education. Her father left home when she was just 9 years old, and Rivera didn't see him again for almost a decade. So, some had low expectations for what Rivera would be able to accomplish in life.</p>
<p>""I had the experience of being told that I'd amount to nothing, I'd be on welfare, I'd basically never make anything of myself,"" she recalled. After turning to books and to faith, Rivera said, she proved those bleak predictions wrong. Instead, they ""gave me the kind of heart you have to have, the kind of hunger that you want to succeed.""</p>
<p>In March, the successful businesswoman who holds four degrees from Stanford — including an MBA — was elected to the Stanford University Board of Trustees. Her 5-year term expires in 2013.</p>
<p>Including Rivera, 13 Stanford MBAs now sit on the 33-member board.</p>
<p>Rivera's election to Stanford's board came a week after she received the 2008 Jerry I. Porras Latino Leadership Award from the Hispanic Business Students Association of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. It was during her acceptance speech there that she discussed her modest beginnings, her rise through the business world to become vice president and deputy general counsel of search engine giant Google, and how humility as well as drive have contributed to her success.</p>
<p>Rivera credited her mother with instilling her with compassion, an essential trait for a good leader. She recalled the time when a young runaway who had fallen into prostitution showed up on the family's doorstep, pleading to use their telephone to call the police. Her mother let the young woman in, and they all waited together until the authorities came. ""That's what character meant to me, in terms of how you help people,"" Rivera said.</p>
<p>She said those striving for their own success also should lift others to better circumstances along the way. As an example, she looked to the military world and Carl Brashear, who in 1970 became the first African American U.S. Navy Master Diver. ""People who hunger to be successful for more than just themselves are almost always in a better spot than somebody who is just thinking of Number One,"" Rivera said. ""I totally believe this is what true leadership is about.""</p>
<p>Then, she described how many people have contributed to her success, including her supportive husband and the nanny who helped the couple raise their two daughters as Rivera climbed the corporate ranks.</p>
<p>Rivera urged her listeners to keep their egos in check as they build their careers, not to be hypnotized by heftyt salaries and the fancy cars and big homes they can buy. ""Have, or be, a supporter"" of someone else trying to get ahead, she urged. Rivera gave as an example her experience at On Your Mind, a venture-backed enterprise software company she cofounded. Once she had to lay off a close friend there. But that friend later recommended Rivera for her first job at Google. ""Most likely it's you and many other people who were responsible for the success that you have,"" she said. ""So, treat people well. Meaningful relationships count for a lot.""</p>
<p>Rivera is a former vice president and deputy general counsel of Google. In that post, she led the legal teams for several of the company's operations worldwide. Before that, she served as associate general counsel, managing Google's revenue and commercial partnership practice. She continues to serve as a secretary to the board of the Google Foundation, the company's philanthropic arm.</p>
<p>Prior to Google, Rivera worked as in-house counsel for Sunnyvale-based software maker Ariba. Earlier, she cofounded On Your Mind, a software firm later known as Outcome Software. Rivera also worked as a strategy consultant for Andersen Consulting, now Accenture.</p>
<p>Currently, Rivera said she is ""taking a hiatus from the work world"" to concentrate on her philanthropic ventures, family, and friends.</p>
<p>She earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Stanford University in 1986, followed by a master's degree in Spanish (Caribbean literature) from the University in 1989. Rivera received her JD/MBA in 1995.</p>
<p>Currently, she serves on the board of visitors of the Stanford Law School and has volunteered with several campus projects, including the Business School's Alumni Consulting Team, which provides pro bono management consulting services to the nonprofit community. She has established a scholarship fund at Stanford for low-income African American and Latino students. She also serves on the board of advisers of Hispanic-Net, a group dedicated to the needs of Hispanic technology entrepreneurs and executives.</p>
<p>Rivera is an active supporter of A Better Chance, which helps minority students attend prestigious prep schools, and La Casa de las Madres, a shelter for battered women in San Francisco.</p>

Joss, dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, addressing the graduates of the School's 83rd Commencement. ""From now on, it will be on what you can actually do.""</p>
<p>Family and friends gathered in Frost Amphitheater on June 14, 2008 to honor this year's 445 graduates. Of the 374 who received the Master of Business Administration degree, 23 are joint graduates with the School of Education and 4 of the School of Law. An additional 46 received Master's Degrees after completing the Sloan program, 22 received doctorates, and 3 received Master of Business Research degrees.</p>
<p>Joss expressed deep appreciation for the ""record-smashing"" class gift pledged by 96 percent of the MBA class, which raised more than $1.2 million for what the '08 Class has named the One Million Dreams Fund. ""You are the most amazing class,"" said Joss.</p>
<p>In introducing the MBA class, Senior Associate Dean David Kreps said, ""The Class of 2008 will be viewed as very special. You were here during a period of exciting change, as we planned a new campus, strengthened our ties to the rest of Stanford, and planned and then began to implement a new MBA curriculum. I can't say it better than did Dean Joss in his last email to the class: 'As the last class to go through the ""old"" curriculum, yours was both a challenging position and one full of opportunity. It might have been tempting to grow frustrated or disengaged. But instead, you took the bold and noble step of acting as our partners in this time of transition.'""</p>
<p>Adam Anderson was named the recipient of this year's Ernest C. Arbuckle Award, presented by Susan, the youngest daughter of the School's third dean. Nominated and chosen by fellow MBA classmates, the awardee is honored as the individual deemed to have contributed most to the School and society through his active participation, initiative, leadership, and personal integrity. Citing a classmate's nominating comment, Arbuckle said, ""If everyone in society had the energy and initiative to match this person's participation in the GSB we would change lives, change organizations, change the world.""</p>
<p>Laura Nisonger received the Alexander A. Robicheck Student Achievement Award in Finance. Established in 1978, this award is given to an MBA student selected by the finance faculty for achievement in finance courses. The award recognizes Professor Robicheck's outstanding contribution to the teaching of finance at Stanford Business School from 1960 until his death in 1978.</p>
<p>Graduating at the top of his class, Alan Resnikoff was named the Henry Ford II Scholar. In recognition of his academic achievement, Resnikoff receives the Miller Scholar scroll, a substantial cash award, and his name engraved on a plaque displayed in the School's South Building.</p>
<p>Senior Associate Dean John Roberts, the John H. Scully Professor of Economics, Strategic Management, and International Business, recognized 67 students in the MBA and Sloan Masters programs who completed a series of courses to earn the Certificate in Global Management. Created in 1994, the School's Global Management Program aims to help students prepare for management careers in a global economy and to highlight the School's emphasis on international business.</p>
<p>William Barnett, the Thomas M. Siebel Professor of Business Leadership, Strategy, and Organizations, acknowledged the accomplishments of the 68 MBA and Sloan Master's recipients of the Certificate in Public Management. Created in 1971, the Public Management Program at first focused almost entirely on government, later broadening to also encompass nonprofit management and socially responsible business.</p>
<p>For the first time, a live webcast allowed far-flung family and friends to share in the celebration. After the ceremony, MBA graduate Leah Vernett Hodge was among 9 graduates to add a personal message when she stood in front of the camera, flashed her diploma, and expressed her love and thanks to her 90-year-old grandparents and mother in Florida, who were unable to travel. Likewise Rhyan Lim Uy, joined by his sister Rachel, stood in front of the camera and said hello to their mother in Cleveland and father in the Philippines. ""Wish you were here. Take care. Looking forward to seeing you back home,"" he said.</p>
<p>""We talk here a lot about changing lives, changing organizations, changing the world,"" said Joss. ""Of course, the lives we made to change are yours so that you would go and change, and build, and strengthen organizations that would change the world—a world that desperately needs new leadership. As we bid you farewell, I hope and I believe strongly that yours are lives that are more promising and more fulfilling because of your time with us, and I wish you well.""</p>",,,302296 | 302336 | 302561 | 302726,,,,,,,,,,,2008 Commencement,http://youtu.be/62xobyDAKkc,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,,,,,MBA,,,,,Helen Chang
1,4256,12/1/08 0:00,Final Exam Includes Real-World Lessons,38,news/headlines/exchallenge08.html,The day-long Executive Challenge 2008 requires first-year MBA students to draw upon all they had learned during the previous three months.,138,"<p>The meeting started with smiles and handshakes around a conference table, as the newly-installed CEO and president of a troubled manufacturing firm met for the first time with the company's four existing vice presidents.</p>
<p>Then, the fireworks began.</p>
<p>During the next 20 minutes, the new executives — actually two Business School students who assumed the roles of incoming management — explained why things had to change and solicited suggestions from their new colleagues on how to turn around the company's operations.</p>
<p>And the company's four vice presidents? They were really Stanford Business School alums playing the part of corporate skeptics at this fictitious company.</p>
<p>It's all part of Executive Challenge 2008, a management trial-by-fire that has been called ""a reality check like no other."" The day-long exercise requires first-year MBA students to draw upon all they had learned during the previous three months in Strategic Leadership, a cornerstone course of the MBA curriculum that teaches students the many facets of what it takes to thrive in an executive leadership role. Held in early December, the Executive Challenge served as a final examination for the class as some 380 students got a chance to showcase their management skills.</p>
<p>About 160 alums, some of whom traveled long distances to take part in the event, either played roles in the simulation or served as judges who gave feedback to the students immediately after observing their live management performance. Participating alums included executives from Intuit, Tesla Motors, Oracle Corp., eHarmony.com, Google, Chevron, and McKinsey & Co.</p>
<p>""It was tougher than I thought,"" admitted first year student Emily Ma, describing the experience, ""but I am so glad I had the opportunity to be here.""</p>
<p>Promptly at 8am, Evelyn Williams, a Business School lecturer and director of the Leadership Laboratories of the Center for Leadership Development and Research, gave the day a kick start — addressing the sea of students who sat before her inside Vidalakis Hall at the Schwab Residential Center.</p>
<p>""The good news is that, no matter what happens in the cases, there is only upside today,"" Williams told the students, all clad in dark suits in keeping with their executive characters. ""So keep that in mind as you are preparing this morning. It is really all about pushing yourself to do the best possible job. No matter what happens, I guarantee you're going to learn something today.""</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after being whisked across campus to Bishop Auditorium on a golf cart, Williams briefed a roomful of alums about what they should expect. ""As we put together this day, one of the overarching themes was how can we bring men and women who have perfected their leadership craft and put them in a situation where they can convey and teach that craft,"" Williams explained.</p>
<p>""I'd like to encourage you to think of this as the future in front of you. We talk here at the GSB about changing organizations and changing the world. Today you have an amazing opportunity to imprint on future leaders of the world how they're going to signal and behave and treat the people who work with them, for them, and above them. So I ask you to think about this as you go through the day — how you can help them go to the next level.""</p>
<p>Management professor Charles O'Reilly echoed that sentiment in his pep talk to alums. ""Why should anybody follow you? Just because you have a degree from Stanford or a title, that doesn't mean you are a leader. We have been trying to design a program that really helps our students think of these issues in a practical way.""</p>
<p>The intricately choreographed day had a host of moving parts. The first-year MBA students were divided into squads of six or eight people. Each was assigned a leadership fellow — a second-year student trained to coach the team on how to make effective presentations, how to run meetings, and other essential skills. Each fellow had participated in last year's edition of the Executive Challenge and so knew something about the situations the first-year students might face — although they were instructed not to let any information slip about what was to come. Students also couldn't use computers, the Internet, mobile telephones, photocopiers, or printers to make handouts for the judges.</p>
<p>Each student team received the same cases, focused on four different corporate scenarios. Students were allowed about an hour to read material associated with the case, decide which two members of their team would assume the required leadership roles, and map out a plan to deal with the challenges. Then, it was on to center stage — a round table set up at the center of a classroom — and the 20-minute role play exercise began.</p>
<p>Getting to interact with seasoned business people rather than role play with other MBA students was an ""exceptional"" experience for Justin Nassiri , MBA Class of '09. ""Walking into that room and seeing heads of companies and board members and directors of boards — and negotiating against them — it was a new feeling.""</p>
<p>The alums serving as judges didn't hesitate to give candid feedback about a student's performance, including things they did wrong, said first-year student Elizabeth Ivester. ""They say it very nicely, but they are very honest,"" she said, adding, ""I think it is very valuable.""</p>
<p>The late-day rally and reception at the Arrillaga Alumni Center after the Executive Challenge ended provided a chance to celebrate and talk informally with business participants, said John Fenwick, MBA Class of '09. ""I realized that this community that I was a part of extended far beyond my classmates … It really extended to the alums.""</p>
<p>""It's very interesting to watch the students deal with things that come up in a day-to-day context in business,"" said Stu Francis, MBA '77, vice chairman of Barclay's Capital, after a day of role playing. ""You don't learn it until you do it, except at Stanford. You learn it here.""</p>
<p>Several of the alums who played the part of corporate executives or judges giving feedback said they wished they had had a similar program in place back when they were in business school. ""It would be great if I had had this,"" said Elizabeth Ronn, MBA '84. ""It's a great way to think about teaching people in a safe environment.""</p>

",141,"<p>""Define your dream and chase it with as much rigor and authenticity as you can muster,"" entrepreneur and philanthropist Jeff Skoll advised Stanford Graduate School of Business 2010 graduates.</p>
<p>""Arguably, most all of you are already successful according to conventional definitions,"" said Skoll, MBA '95, who became the first president of eBay and has gone on to create Participant Media, a firm whose films carrying social messages have won four academy awards. ""But while you're thinking about making money, make sure you're also thinking about making meaning. Money without meaning can be an unfulfilling life.""</p>
<p>Moments before introducing Skoll to the audience filling Frost Amphitheater on the blazing hot afternoon of June 12, Dean Garth Saloner had given some of the same advice: ""Our alumni care not just about themselves and their families, but about their fellow man and woman. And because they are GSB alumni they are action-oriented and do something about it.""</p>
<p>The ceremony honored 351 students who received MBA degrees, 14 PhDs, 54 who earned the Sloan Master of Science Degree, and 3 Master of Arts in Business Research Degrees. Of the students receiving the MBA degrees, 17 also earned masters degrees in education, 3 earned law degrees and 6 were awarded additional masters degrees in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.</p>
<p>Jason LeeKeenan, a Harvard undergrad who grew up in Boston, was named the Henry Ford II Scholar as the top academic student in the class. Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller congratulated the 35 students named Arjay Miller Scholars, meaning that they ranked in the top 10% of the class academically.</p>
<p>Sameer Narang, a Harvard undergrad from Saratoga, Ca., was selected by Stanford GSB faculty to receive the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance.</p>
<p>In addition to their MBA or Sloan degrees, 90 students also earned certificates in public management recognizing that they had taken a specific set of courses. And for the last time, certificates in Global Management were presented to 65 MBA and Sloan students. The Global Management Certificates, created 15 years ago, are being discontinued because the increasing emphasis on international issues in the school's curriculum gives all MBA students access to topics emphasized by the certificate.</p>
<p>Although the ceremony had the usual high spirited feel with families waving and cheering and grads carrying their babies and young children as they received their diplomas, there were three empty chairs among the rows of black robed graduates seated at the front. The dean called for a moment of silence to remember three members of the class who died during their time as students.</p>
<p>Viet Nguyen and Micah Springer were killed in a traffic accident in 2008 shortly after enrolling as MBA students and Roanak Desai, a third member of the class, died in April after a brief illness.</p>
<p>Desai was honored by his classmates with the Arbuckle Award, presented to recognize initiative, leadership, and personal integrity of one of their MBA classmates. This year three other students who were finalists for the award asked that their names be taken out of contention and that the award be presented to Desai. His sister, Paayal Desai, accepted the award on Desai's behalf.</p>
<p>Skoll recalled that when as a teenager his father was diagnosed with cancer. ""He said he wasn't so much afraid that he might die, but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life. Fortunately, my father is still alive today, but for me that was a wakeup call and it set me on a mission.""</p>
<p>Skoll described how his early goal was to become a writer and ""tell stories that would change the world."" When he earned his MBA in '95, his friend Pierre Omidyar approached Skoll with the idea to start eBay. ""I said 'Pierre, what a stupid idea,'"" Skoll recalled. ""Luckily, I soon realized that Pierre was onto something.""</p>
<p>""For me, being part of the creation of eBay was a fantastic experience and gave me the resources to live my dream on a scale I had never imagined. But, throughout, I knew that telling stories that made a difference was what I most wanted to do.""</p>
<p>He has created the philanthropic Skoll Foundation and the Skoll Urgent Threats Fund to focus on problems such as climate change, water scarcity, nuclear proliferation, the middle-east conflict, and pandemics.</p>
<p>Dean Garth Saloner also urged the graduates to have an impact on the world.</p>
<p>""I hope that you, like those who have preceded you, will continue to learn about the world around you and that where you see inequalities, that you will step in and do something about it, perhaps even drawing other GSB alumni into the fray,"" said Saloner. ""In summary, please indulge me just one last time when I say I hope you will lead a life of impact and meaning, and that you will 'change lives, changes organizations, change the world.'""</p>

1,4030,6/12/10 0:00,"2010 Graduation Speech by Jeffrey Skoll, MBA '95",48,news/headlines/2010-speech-Skoll.html,"Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of eBay, urges GSB graduates to define their dreams and chase them with rigor and authenticity. ",131,"<p>Dean Saloner, thank you for the warm welcome. Today marks a full turning point for us, Dean. When I was a student here, and I was co-editor of <em>The Reporter</em>, you didn't answer my calls. Then when I was busy starting eBay, I didn't answer your calls. Then you became the first holder of the Jeffrey Skoll professorship at Stanford GSB and we started answering each other's calls. So congratulations on your first year as Dean and, who knows, maybe soon we can even be Facebook friends?</p>
<p>I am deeply honored to be the first Stanford GSB alumnus to address a graduating class. There have been many notable graduates of the school since it was founded in 1925, including Phil Knight, Charles Schwab and Scott McNealy. There are even a couple of Stanford GSB dropouts that you may have heard of, Steve Ballmer and John F. Kennedy. Imagine what they would have done if they had graduated? But you get me today, and I am grateful to be here.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I sat in the same seats that you are sitting in today, both literally and figuratively. It was the first and only time I had been to the Frost Amphitheater until today. I don't remember a single word that any speaker said. So anything I say here today will likely have a short shelf life.</p>
<p>What I do remember feeling on GSB graduation day is what I imagine you are feeling right now: pride, exhilaration, and gratitude. But remember: none of us made it here entirely on our own. In particular, we had the help and the encouragement of our friends and families. They are the ones bursting with pride right now. So before you hear anything more from me, let's (again) show them how much they mean to you!</p>
<p>When I was with <em>The Reporter</em>, I wrote a regular opinion column, called Northern Exposure, in homage to my Canadian roots. I recently looked back in my archives and found a letter that I had written to my class, from the year 2010. It went something like this:</p>
<p>Dear Graduating Class of 1995, Greetings from the future! I know you are having fungetting togetherfor FOAM nights, LPF events, playing golf and skiing in Tahoe. Well good news, life will be just like that after you graduate!</p>
<p>Actually, not so much.</p>
<p>You will soon be starting your first job out of school.</p>
<p>You will be so busy after you graduate, that you will look back fondly on all the spare time that you had at the GSB. But don't worry, by the year 2010, there will be all kinds of new time saving inventions like smart phones and the Internet and social networking and they will save you so much time you will have yourlife back again.</p>
<p>Actually, not so much.</p>
<p>But there will be some remarkable breakthroughs. In 2010, there will be iPhones, iPods andiPads. There will even be an African-American President from Illinois who will be known by the letter ""O"". But she will prefer to be called President Winfrey.</p>
<p>After you get out of school, almost all of you will be successful in business and you will find that hard work and good choices will help you succeed at whatever you put your hand to.</p>
<p>And, unlike the successful business leaders of your parents' generation, you won't have to wait until you retire to think about giving back, getting involved in your community or philanthropy. In the year 2010, social entrepreneurs like Paul Farmer and Mohammed Yunus will be admired for their work trying to help the world, just as much as many business entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, in 2010, Tiger Woods will still be a great role model.</p>
<p>Actually, not so much.</p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Speaking of role models, I'd like to shift gears and tell you about some of the people who influenced me.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I admired writers whose stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place, writers like Ayn Rand, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. My dream was to tell stories that would change the world.</p>
<p>In those days, my family used to go camping in upstate New York. There wasn't much to do except fight with my sister or read books. So, I opted for the books. By the time I was a teenager, I had read a lot about pollution, nuclear proliferation, and other threats to humankind, and I resolved to try to make the world of the future a better place. I thought I could do that by telling stories that would inspire people to get involved in the issues that affect us all.</p>
<p>Around that time, my father came home one day and announced that he had cancer and that it looked pretty bad. Then he said something that has stuck with me to this day. He said that he wasn't so much afraid that he might die, but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my father is still alive today, but for me that was a wakeup call and it set me on a mission.</p>
<p>I didn't think that writing stories about issues would be the best way to make a living, so I decided to go down an entrepreneurial path so that I could one day afford to write these stories.</p>
<p>Along the way, I started several companies, including the appropriately named ""Micros on the Move,"" a computer rental company that didn't do too well because people kept stealing the computers.</p>
<p>I knew then that I had better go to business school. When I got into Stanford GSB, I was overjoyed, and I set out with an open mind towards new opportunities.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, when my friend Pierre Omidyar approached me with his idea for eBay, I was very sure of what to do. With my newly minted GSB degree in hand, I said ""Pierre, what a stupid idea!"" Luckily, I soon realized that Pierre was onto something.</p>
<p>For me, being part of the creation of eBay was a fantastic experience and gave me the resources to live my dream on a scale I had never imagined. But, throughout, I knew that telling stories that made a difference was what I most wanted to do.</p>
<p>That dream has now taken form as Participant Media, a company I created six years ago. Since then, we have released 25 films, including An Inconvenient Truth, The Cove, Charlie Wilson's War, Syriana, The Soloist and The Kite Runner. These films have been nominated for 17 Academy Awards and have won four times.</p>
<p>But for me it is all comes back to changing the world with a story.</p>
<p>What really makes me happy is to know that the film North Country helped ensure the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act. An Inconvenient Truth brought conversations about global warming into classrooms, living rooms and boardrooms all over the world. And, The Cove has helped to stop the slaughter of dolphins in Japan.</p>
<p>I'm very fortunate that I have been able to live the dreams that I had as a young teenager, and I am forever grateful to Stanford GSB for its important role in my life along the way.</p>
<h2>Finding Your Path</h2>
<p>So how does all this apply to you?</p>
<p>Some of you came to business school already sure of your dreams and your ideal path. Others of you are looking for new ideas, new opportunities, and new paths.</p>
<p>Whether or not you have a firm grasp of your future, I have two messages for each new graduate here today.</p>
<p>My first message is to define your dream and chase it with as much rigor and authenticity as you can muster.</p>
<p>Arguably, most all of you are already successful according to conventional definitions, and most all of you will get out of debt quickly, and make plenty of money. But while you're thinking about making money, make sure you're also thinking about making meaning. Money without meaning can be an unfulfilling life. All of you entrepreneurial graduates here today absolutely can and should seek both.</p>
<p>One GSB graduate and friend of mine, Jacqueline Novogratz, is a perfect example of what I mean. She had been an investment banker, found her passion as an advocate for the poor, and went on to work at the World Bank. She realized there must be a better way, and with the encouragement of her GSB mentor, John Gardner, she decided to start the Acumen Fund. Her work now affects millions of people in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Through the Skoll Foundation, which I created eleven years ago, I work with Jacqueline Novogratz and other leading social entrepreneurs who live their dreams by using their skills to solve the world's most pressing problems. How will each of you pursue and live your dream?</p>
<p>My second message has to do with the urgency of time.</p>
<p>I recently attended my GSB 15<sup>th</sup> year reunion and it has left me in a reflective state.</p>
<p>Three of my classmates are no longer with us. I know that you too have lost classmates recently and that they are very much on your mind today.</p>
<p>There are some lessons in this for all of us.</p>
<p>Right now, it may seem as if you have a lot of time to make decisions that may take you on a path different from where you ultimately want to end up, someday.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to be a painter or a singer or an entrepreneur or a social entrepreneur, but that job with a big salary is calling out. You will get to those other things, someday.</p>
<p>For many people, someday will never come. It certainly never came for our classmates who are no longer with us.</p>
<p>So my second message is that time is more precious than money. Every one of you has the capacity to get more money. But none of us can manufacture more time.</p>
<p>As I finish my thoughts today, I'd like to leave you with these words from Eleanor Roosevelt:</p>
<p>The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.</p>
<p>So, my soon-to-be fellow GSB alumni: seek meaning, focus on your dreams and begin to live them today, not someday … If you do that, then the future will be an unquestionably beautiful place.</p>
<p>Thank you and congratulations!</p>

1,4393,6/1/11 0:00,Professor Margaret Neale Named 2011 Davis Award Recipient,57,news/headlines/neale_davisaward.html,Neale is the 13th recipient and first woman to receive the Davis Award for lifetime achievement by a faculty member.,116,"<p>Margaret A. Neale, who showed that negotiation and teamwork are essential skills for managers, is the 2011 recipient of the Robert T. Davis Award, presented by the Stanford Graduate School of Business deans to recognize a colleague for a lifetime of service and achievement.</p>
<p>Neale, who is the John G. McCoy Banc One Corporation Professor of Organizations and Dispute Resolution, was honored at a faculty dinner that included some good-natured jibes about her record as an administrator and heartfelt thanks for her mentoring of many junior colleagues and for building the behavioral sciences at the school through example, tough love, and negotiation skills.</p>
<p>Besides teaching doctoral, MBA, and Sloan students, Neale works with managers from around the world who take two popular Executive Education programs that she directs: Managing Teams for Innovation and Success and Influence and Negotiation Strategies. She also co-directs the newer Executive Program for Women Leaders. A former student of pharmacy and psychology, Neale, better known to her colleagues as Maggie, latched onto business administration at a doctoral program at the University of Texas and taught at business schools at the University of Arizona and Northwestern University before joining the Stanford business school faculty in 1995.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2000, she also served as an academic associate dean with political scientist David Brady, who at the awards dinner teased that their joint administrative record could not be quantitatively verified. But he added that ""her mentoring of young professors, especially women, is outstanding. Her house is always open to colleagues and their families. Her relationship with graduate students is nurturing but firm. In short, she's done great things for the GSB, Stanford, and her profession.""</p>
<p>Professor Deborah Gruenfeld, who co-directs the Executive Program for Women Leaders with Neale, said she owed a huge debt to her senior colleague. She described Neale as ""whip-smart, fearless, and intimidating. Fiercely loyal, sometimes a little rough, tall, and from Texas. She likes to call the question. Maggie has no patience for nonsense, and she does not hesitate to let you know.""</p>
<p>Neale was already a ""giant"" in the field of organizational behavior when she arrived at Stanford, Gruenfeld said, ""having brought behavioral decision theory to the study of negotiations, and for bringing negotiations research out of the industrial relations arena, where it was seen as a marginal topic having mostly to do with unions, into the forefront of managerial interest, where it is now viewed as a process that is fundamental to management and exchange relationships of all kinds.""</p>
<p>Neale's research on demographic diversity in work teams also brought ""a much-needed theoretical perspective to a tangle of contradictory findings on the one hand, and a chorus of evangelism on the other.""</p>
<p>Neale used her negotiation skills to get funding, space, and staffing for a school-wide behavioral research lab, which increased research productivity and made it possible for the business school to recruit more behavioral scientists, according to Gruenfeld. ""The lab is a tremendous asset for the GSB, providing all kinds of support for the collection, coding, and analysis of behavioral data,"" Gruenfeld said. ""At last count, the behavioral lab was formally associated on the books with the publication of close to 60 peer-reviewed journal articles by GSB faculty and graduate students.""</p>
<p>When Neale arrived at Stanford, the organizational behavior group at the business school had 14 members and the school faculty advisory board had one female member. Sixteen years later, the OB group has nearly doubled, and the advisory board now has ""four women from the OB group alone,"" Gruenfeld said. While not scientific proof of cause and effect, Gruenfeld said she would assert that ""Maggie has been a catalyst, if not a necessary condition, for the growth and fortification of the OB group, the GSB research culture, the MBA curriculum, and Executive Education, as well as the changing face of the school.""</p>
<p>To which Neale added brief thanks for the honor and the observation that she had done nothing by herself for which she was being honored. ""My biggest achievement,"" she said, ""has been the opportunity to be here at Stanford building community with mentoring doctoral students and junior faculty, working with them to have their research have impact and for them to have impact in their institutions.""</p>
<p>Neale is the 13th recipient and the first woman to receive the Davis Award, which is given for lifetime achievement to a current faculty member. The award was endowed by family and friends of the late Robert T. Davis, the Kresge Professor of Marketing, who was a member of the business school faculty for 37 years.</p>

1,4354,3/1/11 0:00,"Mike Aviles, MBA '90, Honored with 2011 Porras Award",52,news/headlines/latinoleadership2011.html,Aviles honored for his significant contribution to the business and Latino communities.,87,"<p>Versatile, turnaround expert, energetic, personable. Those are just a few of the adjectives used to describe Mike A. Aviles. But if you ask him, Aviles, MBA '90, would rather use the word ""lucky.""</p>
<p>Aviles accepted the Jerry I. Porras Latino Leadership Award at a banquet hosted Feb. 26 by the Stanford GSB Hispanic Business Students Association. It was the 15<sup>th</sup> time the association has honored an alumnus who has made a significant contribution to the business and Latino communities.</p>
<p>Aviles, a resident of Austin, Texas, isn't the shortstop for the Kansas City Royals, as he is quick to tell you, but an executive with a track record for managing companies selling products as diverse as software and sunglasses. From 2006 to 2009 he was president and CEO of Vignette Corp., a major player in the enterprise content management industry. Currently, he heads his own consulting firm, Grow2Day LLC.</p>
<p>He has been active in the Young Presidents Association and with the Stanford GSB Alumni Association and mentorship programs. In Austin, he has served on the board of trustees of St. Edward's University.</p>
<p>If he has a passion, Aviles said in his brief remarks at the banquet, it is for education.</p>
<p>""I was born in Puerto Rico, raised in New York, and neither of my parents graduated from college but [they] understood the value of a college education,"" he said. While at Stanford, he worked with the East Palo Alto schools and with the Breakthrough Collaborative, which helps low-income students pursue careers in education.</p>
<p>Stanford holds ""a special place in my heart,"" he said, and it has had a ""tremendous impact on my career and life.""</p>
<p>Before an audience of alumni, faculty, and students, Aviles talked about why he may ""not be the most interesting man in the world but the luckiest. I am blessed in many ways. I was three times a CEO, but how I judge success is family, friends, relationships, experiences, and giving back to the community.""</p>
<p>He offered some advice about work, life, and community:</p>
<p>? Be responsible for your career and your destiny — don't wait for someone to ""give you something."" And find your own way. ""How you define success is about how you define it — not someone else. You have to understand what's really important to you and decide what's best for you.""</p>
<p>He harkened back to his upbringing in Brooklyn. ""My father stated that you can do anything you put your mind to. The first thing you do is convince yourself you can do anything, then convince the person across the table from you.""</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't take too much risk ... or too little. ""Take what risk you're comfortable with. The ones who distinguish themselves ? figured out what to pursue and took appropriate chances to fulfill some of their dreams.""</li>
<li>Be strategic about how you manage your personal life as well as your business. ""Make personal decisions before you make professional ones.""</li>
<li>Embrace the power of positive thinking. ""I carry myself around as if I am the luckiest man.""</li>
<li>Give something back. ""I've learned once you give back to the community you get richer.""</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to his stint at Vignette, which was sold in 2009 to a Canadian competitor, Aviles was president and CEO of Activant Solutions from 1999 to 2004, and president and CEO of Foster Grant Group from 1996 to 1998.</p>

1,4039,6/11/11 0:00,Allison Tells Grads to Follow Personal Compass,46,news/headlines/2011commencement.html,Herb Allison (MBA '71) offered advice to the graduating Class of 2011 at Stanford GSB's June 11 commencement ceremony.,113,"<p>""Live by your own personal compass and speak honestly and openly. If you do that, you'll be fine."" That was the simple advice offered by Herb Allison at this year's Graduate School of Business commencement ceremony on June 11.</p>
<p>Allison, who received his MBA from Stanford in 1971 and most recently headed the nation's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2009, said that his compass was to take the most challenging course, which found him accepting a job offer after graduation at a brokerage firm that then didn't have the market share and cachet of its bigger competitors.</p>
<p>""My 28-year odyssey with Merrill Lynch almost ended before it got started,"" Allison told the 469 degree candidates and the thousands of friends and family members on hand to support them. ""I wrote a memo to the head of investment banking blasting the division's structure and proposing sweeping changes.""</p>
<p>That memo got Allison transferred to Paris, a move he saw as a challenge instead of a punishment. Within a few years he was helping create a stock exchange for a pre-revolutionary Iran. His return to the firm's stateside offices eventually culminated in his becoming president, COO, and board director.</p>
<p>Allison stressed that what matters most is not particular career goals, such as building the next great tech company or leading a not-for-profit, but the code of conduct that will act as a personal compass.</p>
<p>The sentiment of speaking openly and living by one's moral compass was referenced in the opening remarks of Dean Garth Saloner, who said, ""Where you see inequities, step in and do something about them.""</p>
<p>The afternoon ceremony honored 385 students who received MBA degrees, 18 PhDs, 59 who earned the Sloan Master of Science degree, and 6 Master of Arts in Business Research degrees. Of the students receiving MBA degrees, 13 also earned degrees in education, 8 earned degrees in law, 2 earned Humanities and Sciences degrees in public policy, and 14 were awarded earth sciences degrees from the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources.</p>
<p>Jesper Sørensen, the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior, acknowledged the efforts of 99 MBA and 28 Sloan graduates who received a certificate in Public Management. Celebrating its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the Public Management Program focuses on nonprofit management and socially responsible business. This year marks the second-highest number of students receiving the certificate.</p>
<p>His fellow students chose Mahmoud Youssef as this year's Ernest C. Arbuckle Award winner. The award recognizes contributions to the school and society through active participation, initiative, leadership, and personal integrity. In presenting the honor, Susan Arbuckle, youngest daughter of the business school's third dean, said, ""Youssef was best known for being approachable, down to earth, and for having a magnetic personality.""</p>
<p>Graduating at the top of his class with the Henry Ford II Scholar Award was Arvind Iyengar. The award recognizes academic achievement and includes a substantial cash award. Adam Ward received the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance, an honor bestowed to an MBA student by finance faculty for recognition of academic achievement in the field.</p>
<p>The ceremony, held in Frost Amphitheater on a breezy afternoon, concluded with Dean Saloner saluting the recent graduates for a final time.</p>

1,4156,7/1/10 0:00,"Biodesign Course Teams MBAs, Doctors, and Engineers ",52,news/headlines/biodesign_2010.html,Three real-world products have been born as biodesign class projects since the business school joined the cross disciplinary program in 2004,140,"<p>Andy Katz-Mayfield, MBA '11, has a resume that highlights his time with national consulting and equity investing firms. Danielle Weiss, a physician, recently completed a fellowship in endocrinology at Stanford Hospital and Clinics.</p>
<p>In the normal flow of life on the Stanford University campus, there was little chance that their paths would ever cross. And it certainly wasn't likely that they would end up spending hours in a lab that resembled a high-tech kindergarten playroom, debating the best way to manufacture plastic tubing.</p>
<p>But that's exactly what happened when the two scholars enrolled in the cross-disciplinary Biodesign Innovation course.</p>
<p>Offered jointly by the Stanford schools of business and medicine — plus the departments of mechanical engineering and bioengineering — the course simulates the business world where medical doctors, engineers, and MBAs must learn to speak one another's language in order to find answers to stubborn health problems.</p>
<p>Three real-world products have been born as biodesign class projects since the business school became involved with the program in 2004, yet creating companies isn't the program's top goal, said Stefanos Zenios, a member of the business school faculty who co-teaches the course with Paul Yock, the Martha Meier Weiland Professor of Medicine, and Todd Brinton, a clinical assistant professor of medicine (cardiology).</p>
<p>""We are teaching students the process of innovation,"" said Zenios, the Charles A. Holloway Professor of Operations, Information and Technology. ""It is important for us to educate students about how to identify medical needs, invent solutions for those needs, and determine if the solutions are commercially viable. Whether they actually create a business is inconsequential. Being able to analyze that process is what matters the most.""</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Zenios matched Weiss and Katz-Mayfield with other team members, based on their academic training: All had some previous experience in medicine or health care.</p>
<p>Julia Rasooly has two master's degrees from Stanford, one in bioengineering ('08), a discipline that seeks to advance human health, and the other in medicine ('10). Mechanical engineering student Zaafir Kherani, MA '11, possesses an entrepreneurial spirit, a keen interest in medicine, and a desire to bridge the gap ""between doing research in a lab and actually being able to take those results forward into the commercial world.""</p>
<p>Initially, the group appeared no different from the other biodesign teams. However, they soon exhibited some distinctive qualities.</p>
<p>While many student teams select projects in popular areas that are already crowded with entrepreneurial activity, this contrarian group chose peritoneal kidney dialysis, a method used to filter waste products from the blood of people living with kidney failure. Patients often conduct the process themselves, in their homes. It's currently just a small portion of the overall dialysis market and an area where there has been little innovation for 30 years. ""Following that path carried its own challenges, but also gave the team a better chance to create something new,"" Zenios said.</p>
<p>The team's proposed product is an affordable device for home dialysis that lessens the chance of patients developing internal infections. While the class has ended, the team is continuing to work together to create a patentable product — and launch their company, CatheNect Medical.</p>
<p>The team recently received independent validation that they're on the right track after winning a $10,000 prize in the Silicon Valley Boomer Venture Summit Business Plan Competition, which showcases products and services designed to benefit the health needs of people over the age of 45.</p>
<p>To get a sense of what makes the team tick, step into the Clark Center's Brainstorming Room.</p>
<p>There, you'll find two wall clocks — one set to Stanford time, the other set to the local time in New Delhi — a nod to young scientists from India who spent the 2009-10 academic year at Stanford as part of a fellowship program associated with the course. They are now back in India.</p>
<p>Written across the top of the walls are the six tenets of innovation: ""One Conversation at a Time,"" ""Go for Quality,"" ""Be Visual,"" ""Build on the Ideas of Others,"" ""Stay Focused on Topic,"" and ""Defer Judgment."" All four walls double as floor-to-ceiling white boards where team members can jot down notes and diagram ideas gleaned from their research. A cabinet contains low-tech items that can be used to make rough product mock-ups, unexpected things including sparkly purple pipe cleaners, Play Dough, and even life-sized plastic replicas of a human spinal cord and a leg. For more advanced prototypes they can move next door to the Prototyping Studio to work with glass beakers, drills, cutting forceps, a furnace, and microscopes.</p>
<p>Formal coursework ranged from discussions of device regulatory rules and intellectual property guidelines to the patent application process. They also learned firsthand what patients face, with team members frequently conducting interviews at a Menlo Park clinic that teaches people how to conduct home dialysis.</p>
<p>With all that information in hand, the team set out to develop a better way to perform home dialysis, a journey requiring persistence and creativity.</p>
<p>Weiss worried that one early design might not maintain adequate suction and permit fluids to seep out. Based on her opinion, the team decided to scrap that idea.</p>
<p>Another proposal would have used heat to disinfect the dialysis fluid as it flowed from the storage bag through plastic tubing and into the patient's abdomen. But that idea was also dropped based on the reaction of a panel of investors brought in to evaluate student proposals. ""They were skeptical that you would actually be able to heat something up and cool it down so rapidly,"" explained Kherani.</p>
<p>Yet another proposal showcased both the team members' individual expertise and their willingness to learn and compromise.</p>
<p>The four initially wanted to develop a whole new type of plastic tubing used with compatible saline bags. While Weiss, the physician, said such a system would certainly cut down on infection by targeting bacteria commonly found on the skin surface, MBA Katz-Mayfield argued it would cost far too much compared to existing products. So, Rasooly and Kherani, the engineers, thought up a more frugal option, designing tubing less prone to transmitting infection-causing germs.</p>
<p>""At the end of the day, this device has got to work, but cost was certainly a consideration,"" Katz-Mayfield explained.</p>
<p>Now the group is putting the final touches on their product, incorporating their own ideas with feedback they've received during the past months from patients, venture capitalists, and Stanford Hospital nephrology experts. After that, Rasooly and Katz-Mayfield will head the group's effort to present their idea to investors.</p>
<p>No matter where their effort leads, Weiss says she came away from the class having learned a very important lesson: strategic planning. ""Before, I'd think something was a great idea and run with it instead of being really analytical and thinking through each element and how they were all connected,"" she said. ""Now, I think about the future and how things might pan out, and I do that before I start running down a track.""</p>
<p>And, Weiss has gained a diverse set of new colleagues and experience being on a team that is perfecting a novel way to improve people's lives. ""All those things,"" she said, ""are successes for me.""</p>

1,11,10/27/11 0:00,"Charles T. Horngren, Management Accounting Pioneer: 1926-2011",61,news/headlines/horngren_obit_2011.html,"A well-loved member of the Stanford community, Charles Horngren is credited with pioneering modern-day management accounting.",125,"<p>Charles T. Horngren, the Edmund W. Littlefield Professor of Accounting, Emeritus, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, credited with pioneering modern-day management accounting, died Oct. 23 in Palo Alto after a long illness. He was days shy of his 85<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>Known to everyone as Chuck, he was not only a well-loved member of the Stanford community, he was also regarded with the same admiration by his professional peers beyond the university. In 1990 he was inducted into the Accounting Hall of Fame and was honored repeatedly for his contributions to the American Accounting Association, for which he served as president and director of research. His textbook, <em>Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis</em>, is now in its 14<sup>th</sup> edition. It is just one of several of his books that have molded the education of generations of accounting students worldwide.</p>
<p>""He was a straight talker who had time for everyone — faculty, staff, and students alike,"" said Stanford Graduate School of Business Dean Garth Saloner. ""I always found him to be a caring, compassionate, and supportive colleague who took a keen interest in those around him. I will miss him deeply.</p>
<p>""His calm demeanor, even temper, and wry sense of humor were ever-present. He could reliably be found in the faculty lounge at lunch, green apple in hand, and a good story or anecdote at hand. He was a workhorse, sometimes teaching four sections in a single quarter.""</p>
<p>Horngren was credited with changing traditional accounting education in the 1960s ""from cost accounting's overwhelming emphasis on accumulation and calculation of product costs to managerial accounting, which explores the uses of costs for various purposes,"" wrote Thomas Burns, a professor at Ohio State University and chairman of the Accounting Hall of Fame when Horngren was named to the Hall in 1990.</p>
<p>""The use of accounting data for decision-making purposes foreshadowed the informational approach that was to sweep accounting research,"" said William Beaver, one of Horngren's students who today is the Joan E. Horngren Professor of Accounting, Emeritus. ""Chuck defines the term outstanding education in every sense of the word,"" said Beaver. Horngren endowed the professorship in 1984 to honor his wife, who died in 2010.</p>
<p>In addition to the professorship established at the business school, he established the Horngren Family Vitreoretinal Center at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, and the Horngren Family Alzheimer's Research Fund in the Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>The Horngrens were married in 1952 and had four children who survive them: son Scott and his wife, Yone McNally, of Portland, Ore., daughter Mary and husband Dennis Wilson, and daughters Susan and Catherine, all of the San Francisco Bay Area. They are also survived by grandchildren Erik Horngren and Chelsea and Marissa Frost.</p>
<p>A memorial service is planned for 10 a.m., Saturday, Nov. 12, at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 751 Waverley St., Palo Alto. A reception will follow at the Garden Court Hotel, 520 Cowper, Palo Alto. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to Pathways, 585 North Mary Ave., Sunnyvale, Calif., 94085.</p>
<p>Horngren was recruited to the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1966 as Dean Ernest Arbuckle was building an impressive faculty that would earn the school a world-renowned reputation. Horngren brought a friendly, witty personality that made him popular with both his peers and students, and his intellectual powers were always in demand and respected.</p>
<p>His academic work influenced management education, but he also affected accounting practice through his service on professional boards. He advised Stanford University during the indirect cost debate in the 1990s and was a frequent speaker to both academic and professional audiences, always arguing for behavior that met his exacting standards. In 2008 he was asked by a writer for <em>Business Finance</em> magazine what he would do to improve the field of finance.</p>
<p>""I think the whole area of risk needs much closer attention from people who have financial responsibilities, especially when you look at the current subprime disaster. Everyone is blaming everyone else, and I think the whole shooting match is guilty in some respects. There is a lot that could have been avoided, whether through regulation or just smarter people. I am really trying to distinguish between whether it was greed or unwise decision making that got us there. It seems that greed affects decision making too often. The question is, ""How are we going to disentangle the influence of greed and keep it from being destructive to decision making?""</p>
<p>Born in a blue-collar neighborhood of Milwaukee on October 28, 1926, he grew up an avid baseball fan and fantasized for a time about becoming a major league player until reality set in. Following high school graduation, he entered the U.S. Army. In 1946, he enrolled at Marquette University where he majored in accounting and, in his junior year, took a part-time position with the Veterans' Administration to tutor homebound, disabled veterans.</p>
<p>After graduating as class valedictorian in 1949 with a BS degree, he worked in public accounting but soon discovered that he loved teaching and began teaching a heavy load of accounting courses at a for-profit business college. He earned an MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1952. His interest began to focus on decision making by general management, and he developed a better appreciation of accounting as a decision-making tool.</p>
<p>In 1952, the University of Chicago offered him a teaching position in accounting if he would also enroll in the PhD program. At Chicago, William J. Vatter became his mentor and was a stimulating influence in broadening and deepening his interest and conceptual skills. He received his PhD degree in only three years while teaching full time.</p>
<p>Horngren taught at Marquette University and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee before returning to a tenured accounting position at the University of Chicago. There he worked with colleagues Sidney Davidson, Nicholas Dopuch, David Green, and George Sorter, the founding editor of the <em>Journal of Accounting Research,</em> plus outstanding doctoral students including William Beaver, who he later recruited to Stanford, Joel Demski, and Philip Brown.</p>
<p>True to Vatter's influence in financial management, Horngren made major contributions in both financial and management accounting. In the former field, he wrote a number of thoughtful articles, including three with Sorter on ""relevant costing."" He played key roles in helping shape the development of private-sector standard setting by serving on the all-important Accounting Principles Board from 1968 to 1973. Among his more influential articles were several in the 1970s and the 1980s on the efficacy of the standard-setting process. He served as a trustee of the Financial Accounting Foundation, which oversees the Financial Accounting Standards Board, from 1984 to 1989.</p>
<p>As significant as his mark was on the world of financial accounting, Horngren's biggest imprint was on management accounting. Influenced by Vatter's path-breaking textbook, <em>Managerial Accounting,</em> published as a ""preliminary edition"" in 1950, he published his own <em>Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis</em> in 1962. Almost by itself, his textbook changed the field. His objective was to demonstrate to faculty and students alike how the most important role of accounting within a company was as a management tool for making wiser decisions.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1960s, cost accounting textbooks had placed primary emphasis on the construction of inventory cost for use in financial statements and only secondarily conceded space to the management uses of accounting. The book soon became one of the most respected and widely used textbooks in the field, used throughout the world, and is currently in its 14th edition with coauthors Srikant Datar and Madhav Rajan.</p>
<p>He was the author of four other textbooks on financial and management accounting, all of which continue to be published with coauthors in their later editions. In addition, he wrote more than 50 articles on a wide range of accounting topics.</p>
<p>Horngren had long been active in the American Accounting Association, and served as its president from 1976-77. He won numerous awards and accolades including the AAA's inaugural Outstanding Accounting Educator Award presented in 1973.</p>

1,4189,4/1/08 0:00,Leadership Award for Michelle Clayman,37,news/headlines/claymanaward_08.html,"The first woman to receive Stanford GSB's Excellence in Leadership Award, Michelle Clayman has strongly supported women's issues around Stanford.",140,"<p>Even though the institutional money management firm that she runs is in New York, Michelle Clayman clings to her roots at Stanford GSB. To hear her tell it, the recipient of the school's 2008 Excellence in Leadership Award brings up her alma mater possibly a little too often in discussions with her four partners at New Amsterdam Partners LLC.</p>
<p>""I'm forever blathering on about Stanford to the point where their eyes roll back in their heads, and they fall over in catatonic stupors,"" the 1979 MBA joked with the audience gathered in New York's Rainbow Room April 2 to honor her with the award, presented by the Business School. ""And they mock me for talking about us as higher life forms. When we came in from cocktails, they were razzing me because they said there weren't a lot of halos in the room.""</p>
<p>The first woman to receive the award, Clayman has strongly supported women's issues around Stanford. She has particularly championed the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, now renamed the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research.</p>
<p>But the opportunity for her to even go to college, much less get an MBA, might not have happened if it weren't for World War II. Her father had left school at age 14 to go to work, but her mother ended up being evacuated from the United Kingdom to the United States during the war, and had the chance to go to college. When she returned and they began raising their children, Mom made sure the kids had the same opportunity.</p>
<p>For Clayman that meant attending Oxford University in England where she received a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. When she graduated, however, she was told that women in banking faced less sexual discrimination in the United States than in Britain, so she headed to America.</p>
<p>After Clayman worked awhile at Bank of America, a colleague started talking about business school. Two vice presidents at the California bank also encouraged her, saying they would recommend her.</p>
<p>""As far as they were concerned,"" she recalled, ""there was only one business school in the world.""</p>
<p>At Stanford, Clayman met two of the great loves of her life: computers and modern financial theory. ""And they, unlike some of my loves, have stayed with me.""</p>
<p>As it was the '70s, though, there was more than just geek-hood involved. ""There are photos of me dressed as Liza Minelli,"" she told the audience, mentioning that along with intellectual stimulation, there were disco dances and togas and hot tubs and margaritas, as well as once dressing up as a giant artichoke. ""And there are other photos—of which the less said, the better.""</p>
<p>Clayman started working at Salomon, where in early 1980 she was asked to work in a quantitative equity research group. ""A lot of my job was talking to money managers around the U.S. and in Europe about how to use quantitative methods to design investment processes,"" she said. ""At some point the light bulb went on: Why am I showing other people how to do it? Why don't I try doing it myself?""</p>
<p>In 1986 she founded New Amsterdam Partners in New York, where she remains as managing partner and chief investment officer, as well as being a frequent commentator for CNBC, Bloomberg, and other financial media.</p>
<p>And her connection with Stanford remains strong, especially the lessons in how to approach situations. ""There isn't a week that goes by that I don't use something that I learned from my MBA.""</p>
<p>Clayman has been particularly energized from her work with the Women's Initiative Network, formed to help female students and alumnae.</p>
<p>""It's made me feel as if I'm 25 again,"" Clayman joked with her New York audience. ""It almost makes me want to put on that giant artichoke costume.""</p>

1,4477,9/1/07 0:00,Sloan Graduates Take the Road Less Traveled,43,news/headlines/sloan50_road.html,Alumni reflect on uncommon paths they took to and from the Stanford program and how it transformed the way they viewed business and the world.,142,"<p>A U.S. Navy fighter pilot, a best-selling novelist, a medical instrument inventor, and the founder of an underwater logging company (who got into the program even though he didn't finish high school) were on hand to demonstrate the diverse makeup of the Stanford Sloan Program alumni during a 50th anniversary celebration.</p>
<p>The four Sloan alumni, who spoke at the September 14 forum discussion, ""The Road Less Traveled,"" recalled the uncommon paths they each took to and from the Stanford program, describing how it transformed the way they viewed business and the broader world. ""I've had quite a road less traveled,"" said Jesse Kingg, Sloan '05, who is director of quality at Abbott Labs.</p>
<p>Kingg grew up in Pittsburgh and lived in Liberia before returning to the United States to go to college. He later served as a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy, and was known as first submariner-turned-fighter pilot. After retiring from the Navy in 2004, he decided to plunge into the business world and sought more training ""to learn the business of business.""</p>
<p>That experience led him to Stanford where he said he cherished the diversity of his class and the entire campus, meeting people from different countries and backgrounds, many of them bilingual or even trilingual.</p>
<p>Wayne Dunn, Sloan '97, who is president and CEO of Clark Sustainable Resource Developments in British Columbia, Canada, grew up in rural Saskatchewan where he began his career in the logging industry ""on the grunt end of chainsaws."" Even though he dropped out of school after the 11th grade, that didn't stop him from pursuing higher studies at Stanford and aiming big in the business world.</p>
<p>""It was an absolutely transforming year,"" he said of his experience as a Sloan fellow. ""I came here feeling so fortunate. We had the great fortune of having a class that really came together.""</p>
<p>In 2005, Dunn and former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark cofounded Clark Sustainable Resources Developments, which extracts hardwoods from submerged forests left by the creation of a hydro dam in Africa. His company also works closely with local communities, including indigenous groups.</p>
<p>Francis Edward Wintle, Sloan '83, is best known by his pen name, Edward Rutherfurd. Wintle has written several bestselling historical novels, including Sarum, about the ancient monument of Stonehenge and Salisbury, England, and London.</p>
<p>He said being a Sloan fellow was ""a time of personal reevaluation"" for him, when he received ""the gift of confidence"" highlighted by ""the California blue sky that tells you that all things are possible.""</p>
<p>William New, MD, PhD, and Sloan '81, who is chairman of The Novent Group in Palo Alto, already had a successful career as a physician, engineer, and academic before he entered the Sloan Program. Physicians and engineers were always struggling to find better ways to treat illnesses, he said.</p>
<p>""I knew there was an interesting spot that could be productive in the middle. I understand the technology. I understand the medicine. But you have to make a business out of it. That was the part I was missing. That was what attracted me to Sloan ... You learn the vocabulary of business. You learn the culture of business, the values of business.""</p>
<p>His skills as a doctor, engineer, and entrepreneur led him to found Nellcor, which developed the pulse oximeter, a device that helped medical professionals monitor oxygen levels of anesthetized patients. New also founded Natus Medical Inc., which makes a low-cost device to screen newborns for hearing loss.</p>
<p>""I wanted to do well by doing good ... to take technology, take business, and take the two together and make the world a better place,"" he said</p>
<p>Founded in 1957, the Sloan Program is named for Alfred P. Sloan, the philanthropist and longtime chairman and CEO of General Motors.</p>
<p>Sloan's grant was used to launch the program that today attracts roughly 56 mid-career managers for a 10-month academic program leading to a Master's of Science in Management degree. More than 700 Sloan alumni and family members attended the reunion held September 13-15.</p>

1,3851,5/1/09 0:00,"Professors Strebulaev, Jagolinzer, and Shiv Honored for Teaching",64,news/headlines/09teaching_awards.html,"School's MBA, PhD and master's students recognize three faculty members for their innovative teaching methods, enthusiasm and personal attention.",145,"<p>Stanford Graduate School of Business faculty members <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/ilya-strebulaev"">Ilya Strebulaev</a>, <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/baba-shiv"">Baba Shiv</a>, and Alan Jagolinzer were honored with 2009 Distinguished Teaching Awards by students in the school's MBA, PhD, and Sloan Master's Program, respectively.</p>
<p>Strebulaev, an associate professor of finance, inspired MBA students with his mastery of classroom dynamics, ""including the use of the technique every MBA student, worldwide, is taught to fear—the cold call,"" said MBA student Roanak Desai. He sets high expectations for them as well as for himself, rigorously challenging his students; he integrates real-world relevance into the classroom by regularly drawing on the day's headlines; and he demonstrates a sincere enthusiasm to help students both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>Responding to students' comments about his use of the cold call, Strebulaev said, ""When I first came to Stanford five years ago, my colleagues told me, 'First-year professors are usually scared, and MBA students can go after them.' Well, I did get scared, and when I thought about what to do about it, I decided that I should get YOU before you could get ME. That is the origin of cold calling, and it seems that this strategy has worked.""</p>
<p>Several students noted he learns and memorizes everyone's name and background prior to the first class. ""You deserve no less than that,"" he said. He makes this extra effort, he said, because ""I have come to believe over these years, strongly and passionately, that in any class I teach at the GSB I do see in front of me the future leaders of our society — those whose decisions will affect many and whose judgment will change lives. Feeling that I have contributed even marginally to these future judgments and decisions is both thrilling and deeply satisfying.""</p>
<p>Acknowledging the particular significance of this year's award, Strebulaev noted, ""It is, of course, even more special because the recipient of last year's award who stood in my place a year ago, Professor Garth Saloner, has just been announced as our new Dean, who will lead the GSB for many years to come.""</p>
<p>Shiv, a professor of marketing and a Graduate School of Business Trust Faculty Fellow for 2008-2009, received the PhD Distinguished Service Award for his personal warmth, infectious enthusiasm, and motivational energy. ""His positivity can electro-shock back to life things that have started to seem stale, and in a way that reminds us, especially when wracked with doubt and self-questioning, why we thought they were interesting in the first place,"" said doctoral student Abninder Litt. Others also appreciated that Shiv fostered a greater sense of community among PhD students, generously volunteering even his family members' time to student projects. Shiv was also praised as an ""awesome teacher"" who effectively straddles both the world of research and classroom with ease: ""Besides teaching us how to think about ideas in a more holistic manner, he also taught us some invaluable lessons about the publication process.""</p>
<p>Students in the Sloan Master's Program honored Jagolinzer with the Sloan Teaching Excellence Award, citing dedication to students, integrity, and innovative teaching. Jagolinzer, who is an assistant professor of accounting and the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Faculty Scholar, impressed students with his ability to tailor his two courses to the students' differing ability levels and prior experience. ""He kept every class interesting, and really made an effort to incorporate students' feedback throughout the course,"" said one student John Matsushima.</p>

1,4064,9/1/07 0:00,Sustainable  Business Approaches Explored In New Executive Program,66,news/headlines/ExEdSustainability.html,"Uncommon gathering of people from private, public, and nonprofit sectors come together to grapple with tough issues.",116,"<p>With the pristine Fallen Leaf Lake as backdrop, a Stanford Graduate School of Business executive education class spent a week in the Sierra Nevada trying to answer some of the toughest questions facing businesses today: How can companies operate without doing harm to the environment? What will it cost? Is it worth it?</p>
<p>It was an uncommon gathering of people who would not typically expect to sit together to grapple with these issues.</p>
<p>There were executives from Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, and Conoco Phillips. There were advocates from The Nature Conservancy and Ocean Conservancy. One participant was the founder of a Panamanian nonprofit promoting eco-tourism. Another, an eco-strategist for a Chicago-based global advertising agency focused on environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>The Business Strategies for Environmental Sustainability Program, an executive offering done in conjunction with the Business School's Center for Social Innovation, underscored an important business trend: More companies in a variety of industries are looking hard at the way they do business to see how to do the least harm to the environment. They do so because of growing public awareness about environmental damage, because their competitors are doing it, and because it is good for business in general.</p>
<p>But as the program, led by William Barnett, highlighted, going green isn't always easy. The biggest issue is cost.</p>
<p>""If we increase efficiencies without incurring increased costs, we don't have to pay more,"" said Barnett, the Thomas M. Siebel Professor of Business Leadership, Strategy, and Organizations at the Business School. ""But to the extent that we're looking at improvements beyond increases in efficiency and they require bringing in costs, the price will go up. That's just the way it is.""</p>
<p>The 31 participants (including a CEO, five vice presidents, and more than a dozen managers) tackled these concerns by delving into the experiences of specific businesses and organizations. The case studies raised important questions.</p>
<p>How should a successful supermarket offering organic food products respond to criticisms from advocacy groups arguing that it is not green enough — and to the growing challenge from bigger competitors moving steadily into its niche market?</p>
<p>How can a California lumber company hoping to become the leading supplier of environmentally friendly building materials deal with the pressures of competition, diverse customer tastes, and changing building standards?</p>
<p>How has a major coffee retailer's decision to buy high-quality beans only from farmers who are not exploited by their trading partners and who use environmentally sound farming methods affected its bottom line? With the growing public awareness of global warming and other serious environmental problems, many companies have found that being green, either by maintaining an environmentally sound supply chain or reducing energy consumption, pays off, Hau Lee said.</p>
<p>""This is a dimension that will be important in business. This is a dimension that people care about."" Lee is the school's Thoma Professor of Operations, Information, and Technology.</p>
<p>Erica Plambeck, associate professor of operations, information, and technology, stressed the importance of providing ""credible information"" and standards about one's efforts to go green.</p>
<p>""Businesses must find a way to create a willingness among customers to pay for environmental quality,"" she said. ""They must establish credible information about the environmental attributes of products.""</p>
<p>For environmental advocacy groups, the business world's ongoing bid to go green presents opportunities — but also challenges.</p>
<p>One is the inevitable tension between the purists and the pragmatists in the environmental movement.</p>
<p>""Some of my fellow students don't exactly have a warm spot in their hearts for activist groups that pursue radical or semi-radical actions to ""'speak truth to power,'"" Mark Powell, vice president for fish conservation at Ocean Conservancy, wrote in <a href=""http://blogfishx.blogspot.com"" target=""_blank"">his blog</a>.</p>
<p>He argued that it is important for environmental groups to work with major corporations because that allows these organizations to effect positive changes and reach a broader audience.</p>
<p>Kenneth Siegler, worldwide director of Hewlett-Packard's Green Initiative Program, affirmed this, saying: ""I'm really concerned that if we don't have a two-way street or an open door policy, we will not be able to implement a lot of these processes.""</p>
<p>But the purists — the groups who set the highest standards for environmental sustainability — also have a role to play, some participants agreed.</p>
<p>""We need some purists not working with [corporations], keeping us honest,"" said George Leonard, senior science manager for the Seafood Watch program of the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p>Plambeck underscored this point. ""We need the critics as well as the collaborators.""</p>
<p>Rich Kelleman, vice president and eco-strategist for Rivet, a Chicago-based marketing company, said the program offered ""a ton of opportunity in exploring sustainability in the marketing/communications world. Not only in communicating steps that our clients are taking, but in fundamentally rethinking the way that an agency works/operates and the canvases that we use for our creative product.""</p>
<p>Elizabeth Trask, manager of corporate partnerships at Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Defense, said it was ""an amazing opportunity tothink through some of the toughest environmental issues of the day with a dedicated group of professionals from industry, government, and nonprofits, guided by brilliant faculty.""</p>
<p>While the program explored issues that have been discussed and debated for years, Powell wrote in his blog, ""The program definitely took me to new heights on this line of thinking. I heard specific case studies of people building alignment where there was once no alignment, to real advantage. I heard business leaders in the class groping for solutions, just like me. Did you hear that? They were looking for solutions, just like me. What do ya know?! As they say where I come from: 'Well, shut my mouth.' And maybe, once or twice, I did.""</p>
<p>The program, he added, changed his attitude toward business schools which have typically been viewed as a place where people learn how to make money.</p>
<p>""Why can I learn so much from a business school perspective?"" he writes. ""Simple really, the study of business strategies is just the study of change, and I'm in the business of promoting change ... I guess I have to admit that a business school perspective isn't actually evil. That's a surprise since business schools are viewed as the brain trust of capitalism, the place where people go to learn how to make money, and environmental dogma has sometimes held that money and capitalism are the enemy.""</p>
<p>On the other hand, another participant, Paul A. King, vice president and sustainability executive of Bovis Lend Lease, said the program gave him an opportunity to see business and environmental issues through the eyes of nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>""Your new perspectives on business mirror my new perspective on NGOs,"" he said in a comment on Powell's blog. ""Professor Barnett pulled off something wonderfully stimulating and motivating here.""</p>
<p>Powell said his ""biggest take-home message"" from Business Strategies for Environmental Sustainability was that ""change advocates can learn a lot from studying business strategies … Kudos to organizer Professor 'Wild' Bill Barnett and his team for a truly great learning experience. This very strong program is in its first year and deserves to continue.""</p>

<p>At FOAM, in a time-honored tradition, you have declared yourselves to be ""Friends of Arjay Miller!"" I am so delighted that Arjay is with us today. Fittingly, Arjay will personally acknowledge the Arjay Miller Scholars when we hand out the MBA diplomas.</p>
<p>What does your graduation signify? At one level, of course, it means simply that you have satisfied the requirements for the degree. But as you know, studying at Stanford GSB means so much more than mastering the concepts of management; it is as much about personal transformation. As you sit before us anxious to receive your diplomas, I encourage you to reflect on how you have changed and grown during your time here. Your graduation today celebrates all that you have done and become, and your readiness to have a dramatic and positive impact on the organizations you will lead, manage, or found, and through those organizations, the communities they serve.</p>
<p>What you have accomplished in your time at Stanford GSB, you have not accomplished alone. You have learned and received help, guidance, mentorship, and support from many quarters, all of which are represented here today.</p>
<p>First, you are sitting shoulder to shoulder with your classmates as you have throughout your time here. Think how much you have learned from one another, in study groups, squads, students clubs, study trips, Talk12, the View From the Bottom, or just in quiet conversation together. You have forged bonds here that will become lifelong friendships that will nurture and sustain you in the years ahead. Take a moment to show your appreciation for one another.</p>
<p>Sitting behind me on the stage is a group of faculty who represent the more than 150 tenure line faculty and practitioners who have been your teachers, coaches, mentors, study trip companions, career advisors, and so much more. I would ask the faculty to stand so that your students can express their appreciation.</p>
<p>And at various locations throughout the amphitheater are staff from the MBA, Sloan, and PhD Programs. Without their tireless efforts on behalf of all of us, none of us would be celebrating here today. I ask the staff to stand, wherever they are, and be recognized. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the special contributions of the leaders of two programs who are presiding with us today for the final time — the Director of the Sloan Program, Marie Mookini, and Sharon Hoffman, the Director of the MBA Program. Please join me in recognizing them for their incredible contributions.</p>
<p>I have left the most important for last. Each of you has been supported by family and friends as you will be throughout your lives. They have provided encouragement, validation, love, and, yes, in many cases financial support too! While we will hand the diplomas to you, you know that in parentheses after your name belong the names of those who have nurtured you and supported you along the way. This is your opportunity to stand and say ""thank you"" to your friends and family who are celebrating your mutual accomplishment here today.</p>
<p>As most of you know my daughter Romy has just completed her first year in the MBA Program. She reminded me recently of a conversation we had some time in the Fall quarter over a latte in the TA café. She remarked at the time that it was really sinking in for her that our community had high expectations for those who had been privileged to gain admission here. That we take ""change lives, change organizations, change the world"" seriously. That we do everything we can to create an environment here where our students can harness their potential not only so they CAN go on to lives of consequence and meaning, but that we <em>expect</em> them to. What I was thinking was ""Umm, haven't you seen my license plate?"" [which says ""Change 3""] but, as she recalls I looked at her and said only one word: ""Good!""</p>
<p>In this season of graduation I am often forwarded speeches that have been made at other institutions which, being on the semester system, graduate before us. This year I am struck by how many of them reference the role of luck in personal success. One can guess what the sentiments are in society today that are causing the national consciousness to dwell on the relative importance of privilege versus earned success. But I think that it is clear that while we can trace a great deal of what we have accomplished to our hard work, talents, and drive, we must surely admit — at least to ourselves in the privacy of our own thoughts — that for each of us good fortune has played a role — whether a helping hand along the way, a break on a college admissions decision, being born in the right place at the right time, or countless other reasons that others with the same talent endowments as us are less fortunately positioned. And surely at least that portion of our success creates an obligation to give back, to share our largesse with others.</p>
<p>As the Dean of Stanford GSB I am honored to be part of an alumni community that embraces a commitment to tackle the world's greatest problems, to make an enduring, positive commitment to the world around us. Because the biggest challenges in the world today — in business, education, healthcare, the environment, public policy — are leadership and management challenges. It is in this spirit that I am so delighted to welcome all of you into Stanford GSB alumni community today.</p>
<p>It is now my privilege to introduce you to one such alumnus, John Morgridge.</p>
<p>John has had a long and accomplished career and I won't regale you with all the details. But here are some of the most important. John grew up in Wisconsin and went to college at the University of Wisconsin where he had a variety of part-time jobs including washing equipment in a sweet pea cannery, digging stone at a quarry, washing walls in Milwaukee's Pabst Brewery, doing road construction on Highway 64, and working as a railroad brakeman. He went on to earn his MBA from the Stanford GSB in 1957.</p>
<p>The crowning achievement of a long and successful career occurred when he took the helm of the fledgling Cisco systems in 1988. Under his leadership the company's revenues grew from a mere $5 million to more than a billion dollars by 1995, and the number of employees from 34 to over 2250. As such, John presided over the growth of one of the great Silicon Valley success stories, in the process nurturing a unique culture than enabled the company to continue to thrive and scale after he stepped down as CEO.</p>
<p>John met his wife Tashia in high school and the two of them have joined the Giving Pledge, pledging to donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes.</p>
<p>John is a trustee of Stanford University and a member of Stanford GSB's Advisory Council. In 1996, he received the Stanford GSB's Arbuckle Award for excellence in management leadership.</p>
<p>Numerous Stanford GSB classes have had the privilege of learning from John in his role as a lecturer, and many more from his guest appearances in classes he has taught at the behest of other faculty, myself included. I feel privileged to count John among the school's closest advisors. I have learned so much from him, in so many different capacities.</p>
<p>Please join me in giving John Morgridge a warm Stanford GSB welcome!</p>",,,303071,,,36681 | 36621,Certificate & Award Recipients,visit/commencement/certificate-award-recipients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Career & Success,,,Cisco,MBA,,,,,Katie Pandes
1,3981,6/1/06 0:00,"Outstanding Teaching, Scholarship, Cited in 2006 Awards to Professors",69,news/headlines/2006_dist_teach_award.shtml,"Students honored professors George Parker, Mary Barth, and Peter DeMarzo as 2006 recipients of three awards for outstanding faculty members.",140,"<p>Professors George Parker, Mary Barth, and Peter DeMarzo, from the finance and accounting faculty, are the 2006 recipients of the three awards presented by students at the Stanford Graduate School of Business to outstanding faculty members.</p>
<p>Parker, the Dean Witter Professor of Finance and Management, Emeritus, who has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business for 33 years, was honored with the 2006 Distinguished Teaching Award presented by MBA students.</p>
<p>Barth, the Joan E. Horngren Professor of Accounting and senior associate dean for academic affairs at the School, was cited by PhD students for her outstanding support of their academic work and her personal dedication to their careers.</p>
<p>DeMarzo, the Mizuho Financial Group Professor of Finance, was honored by fellows in the Sloan Program for making the difficult required finance course comprehensible to students with varied finance backgrounds.</p>
<p>Parker's Corporate Finance ""course was one of the most fun courses I have taken,"" shared one student. Another wrote: ""[He] was amazingly gifted at making [this subject] accessible to everyone, from the strongest quant jock to the serious poet. Although I had him in an 8am class, I looked forward to his class every day.""</p>
<p>In accepting the Distinguished Teaching Award at a recent noontime ceremony, Parker acknowledged the support of wife, Joan, ""who was impressed,"" said Parker, ""but she said I still have to take out the trash."" Parker also expressed his gratitude for his role models: the faculty who taught him as he earned an MBA and PhD from Stanford GSB, as well as colleague James Van Horne, a two-time winner of the Distinguished Teaching Award whom Parker considers ""a master teacher in every regard.""</p>
<p>Since joining the faculty in 1973 to teach and direct the Sloan Master's Program, Parker also has overseen the school's executive education program and served as senior associate dean for academic affairs and director of the MBA Program. ""I've done everything there is to do here except serve as dean and clip the flowers,"" quipped Parker in an interview. Three years ago, he was honored with the Robert T. Davis Award presented by the faculty to a colleague in recognition of lifetime service to Stanford GSB.</p>
<p>In honoring Barth, who joined the business school faculty in 1995, doctoral students praised her supportive relationship with them and their work, while recognizing that at the same time she holds the influential position as one of 14 members of the International Accounting Standards Board.</p>
<p>""Mary has somewhat of a celebrity status,"" wrote one student. ""I've been to conferences in Europe on two occasions, and PhD students over there seem amazed that she is my advisor and that I know her personally. You could consider her the Michael Jordan of accounting.""</p>
<p>""Mary is one of the main reasons I chose to come to Stanford,"" wrote another. ""She is unique in that her work has had as much of an influence on accounting practice as it has had in academia. She is a role model for me in my career.""</p>
<p>Said another: ""Each time I give her a draft of my work, the level of detail in her feedback and thoughtfulness in her comments leave me with the impression that she knows my work better than I do.""</p>
<p>In 1996 Barth received the MBA Distinguished Teaching Award.</p>
<p>The one-year Sloan Masters Program includes 54 mid-career managers, some with less expertise in finance than others. In honoring DeMarzo, Sloan students cited his ability to reach the entire class.</p>
<p>""He took an extremely complex course and managed brilliantly across an array of abilities [of individual students]. The class was fun, demanding, and extremely informative. I am finding subsequent finance courses easier because of the foundation he gave us,"" wrote one student.</p>
<p>""He has managed to strike a good balance in ensuring that the beginners can follow, and the experienced students feel challenged.""</p>
<p>It was the second time DeMarzo had been honored by the Sloan Fellows. He also won their teaching award in 2004.</p>",,,302481 | 302061 | 302151,,,,Distinguished Faculty Service Award | Faculty Honors & Awards,programs/phd/academic-experience/faculty | faculty-research/faculty/awards-honors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,,,,,PhD,,,,,Helen Chang
1,4320,1/1/11 0:00,Students in Joint MBA/MS Degree Focus on the Environment,56,news/headlines/ieprwinners_121810.html,Business school students in the interdisciplinary MBA/MS joint degree program complete graduate studies in the School of Earth Sciences,135,"<p>Nuclear power plants don't have to be as expensive and large as they currently are if they utilize Small Modular Nuclear Reactors, which could be the future of atomic power generation. Glorified golf carts could be an important mode of transportation for the 93% of trips that take Americans less than five miles from their home, but will require a change in consumer behavior to take hold. And charging motorists to follow certain traffic patterns could go a long way to relieving congestion.</p>
<p>These were a few conclusions reached in December by three interdisciplinary students working toward joint degrees when they presented their final Capstone Projects to faculty, fellow students, and friends at a symposium held by the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources. In addition to earning MBA degrees, the students also are working toward Master of Science degrees - preparing to become the next generation of scholars and leaders to address the world's most challenging environmental and sustainability problems.</p>
<p>Megan Guy, MBA/MS Class of '11, presented a detailed analysis comparing the large Light Water Reactors generally in use today to the newer, more streamlined SMRs coming to market. The Small Modular Nuclear Reactors typically measure 14' x 60' and can be built offsite, thus reducing construction times and costs.</p>
<p>""A major benefit of the SMRs is they require less fuel, which also doesn't need to be replenished as often, producing far less waste,"" Guy said. No SMRs have yet to be installed in the United States, although applications have been submitted. She said the SMRs will require a level of flexibility from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which until now had been basing its construction, safety, and operating protocols around the traditional LWRs. Guy's Capstone project was selected by a faculty committee as the winning project of the quarter.</p>
<p>Graeme Waitzkin, MBA/MS Class of '11, demonstrated how stripped-down electric Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs), like golf carts, leave a much smaller carbon footprint than the battery-operated Tesla Roadster and Nissan Leaf. Because 93% of U.S. auto trips are less than 5 miles, he contends that an electric vehicle that can travel at high speeds and longer distances isn't always needed.</p>
<p>Waitzkin worked with WENG Motor Co., a spinoff from Stanford's Product Design Network, and said current LSV users are small fleets, like a college campus or retirees who live in closed communities. ""A mobility behavior change in customers is needed before LSVs can catch on,"" Waitzkin said. However, he pointed to the spike in scooter sales when gasoline prices skyrocketed in 2008 as proof behavior can change.</p>
<p>Eli Gregory, MBA/MS Class of '11, looked at the effect passenger vehicle congestion had on U.S. CO2 emissions. From 1982 to 2007, he said, fuel wasted annually per peak traveler grew from 9 gallons to 24 as the delay due to congestion rose from 14 hours to 36. Traffic congestion typically produces higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than faster moving vehicles. A majority of the excess fuel is spent in 14 major U.S. metropolitan areas, one of those the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>Gregory studied how several approaches in the Bay Area could mitigate congestion. One option was cordoning off the Northeast section of San Francisco during peak hours and charging all vehicles driving through that zone, similar to a current system in London. Another proposal involved conversion of carpool lanes to High Occupancy/Toll Lanes, which would relieve congestion in the remaining lanes. His third solution was peak pricing on the Bay Bridge, which could decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 52% during morning peak travel time.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary Joint MBA/MS degree, which was approved by Stanford's faculty senate in 2007, allows MBA students to apply during their first year to complete a joint MS/MBA degree with E-IPER, an interdisciplinary graduate program in the School of Earth Sciences that includes affiliated faculty from all seven schools at Stanford. Once accepted, students continue their MBA courses and simultaneously take classes toward the MS. Typically students, who design their own course of study, take two years plus one to three additional quarters to complete both degrees, which are awarded simultaneously. Since the program's inception 48 business students are in the process of or have completed the program.</p>

<p>The one-week, custom-designed NFL-Stanford Program included sessions led by Stanford Business School faculty members as well as speakers from professional football including Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, and former San Francisco 49er player Ronnie Lott.</p>
<p>The NFL-Stanford Program is codirected by  management professor George Foster and lecturer Bill Walsh, Hall of Fame NFL coach and former general manager of the San Francisco 49ers. ""This is an opportunity to get a broad and strategic understanding of the industry, operations, and competition from Stanford GSB professors and NFL management,"" said Walsh, who is also a former Stanford football coach. ""We give a complete program from which participants can gain invaluable experience, plus there is important networking and peer sharing in the process.""</p>
<p>""This type of executive development has a strong impact on the front office as well as the team executives who are present,"" said Gene Washington, NFL director of football operations, who attended the June 21-25 classes on the Stanford campus. He also took part in the first NFL-Stanford Program in 2003.</p>
<p>The program grew out of an expertise in sports management developed for the Stanford MBA Program through the collaboration of Foster and Walsh. Walsh had supported the idea of executive development within the NFL for years. Washington visited Stanford in 2003 as a speaker in one of Foster and Walsh's MBA classes, saw the content Stanford had developed, and launched discussions about a custom program for the league. ""Our objective is to develop and deepen the core business skills of the participants and give them a greater appreciation of all aspects of the NFL and the clubs,"" said Foster, who is the Paul L. and Phyllis Wattis Professor of Management.</p>
<p>In addition to Stanford faculty, program speakers included Bill Polian, president of the Indianapolis Colts; Rod Graves, vice president of football operations for the Arizona Cardinals; John Jones, executive vice president and COO of the Green Bay Packers; Carmen Policy, executive adviser at the Cleveland Browns; and Art Shell, supervisor of football operations for the National Football League.</p>
<p>Sessions included topics such as ""Team Economics and Stadium Management""; ""Foundations of Team Effectiveness""; ""What Makes a Great Executive in the Sports Industry""; ""Negotiation Strategies and Tactics""; and ""The Future of Football.""</p>",,,302186,,,,Executive Education,exed/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,Leadership | Management | Education,,,,,,,,,Helen Chang
1,3892,6/2/03 0:00,"Feinberg, Duffie, and Kasznik Honored as Distinguished Teachers",63,news/headlines/2003teachingawards.shtml,"A ""command performer,"" ""master of asset pricing,"" and a professor who creates a safe environment for learning are recognized by Stanford GSB students.",150,"<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/yossi-feinberg"">Yossi Feinberg</a>, associate professor of economics, was honored with the 2003 Distinguished Teaching Award at a noontime ceremony May 27.</p>
<p>In addition, doctoral students honored <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/darrell-duffie"">Darrell Duffie</a> with the PhD Distinguished Service Award for his teaching, advice, and support of students and the academic process. The Sloan Excellence in Teaching Award went to <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/ron-kasznik"">Ron Kasznik</a> for the second time in three years.</p>
<p>""The quality of teaching here is amazing,"" remarked a humble Feinberg when he accepted the MBA award. ""I still think there's a mistake,"" he joked.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the praise for Feinberg, as cited by first-year MBA student John Abbamondi, who introduced him. ""What shows up again and again in these comments [from fellow students] is the portrait of a man who taught with wisdom and compassion, simultaneously pushing his students extremely hard while doing everything he could to ensure that they succeeded."" Most notably, he added, although the professor was demanding of his students, he demanded even more from himself.</p>
<p>""His lectures were like command performances,"" said one nominator.</p>
<p>""He is, quite simply, the best teacher I've ever had,"" said another. ""He made the complex clear, the dull delightful, and the hour-and-forty-five minutes seem too short. I've never met a teacher who so clearly cared about his students, who wanted so much for them to succeed that he confessed, prior to our midterm, that as stressed as we might be, he was more nervous still. But he had nothing to worry about, because he is, in my opinion, the most outstanding professor in the core.""</p>
<p>Yet Feinberg professed occasional doubts about the quality of his teaching, said Abbamondi, relating a comment the faculty member made over lunch one day: ""'When you come to Stanford and start teaching here,' Feinberg said, 'you look around and quickly realize that everyone here is an amazing teacher — everyone but you. It's so intimidating.'""</p>
<p>Kicking off the ceremony, Stanford GSB Dean Robert Joss set the context for the award. ""Here at the Stanford Business School, we produce ideas and graduates who are expected to have a high impact on the world,"" he said. ""Our faculty play a key part in the production of both.""</p>
<p>In nominating Darrell Duffie, pictured here, for the PhD award, one doctoral student noted: ""Darrell is the most dedicated teacher I have ever had. He wants all students in his class to learn, and is willing to put in the effort and time to make sure that happens. The best students from math, statistics, engineering, economics, and the GSB take this class. There is no better way to learn asset pricing than from the master.""</p>
<p>Students also praised Duffie for supporting their job searches, helping them expand their educational horizons, and spending his personal time on their issues. ""Knowing the wide range of activities he is involved with, obligations facing him, the tremendous interest so many people have in interacting with him, I marvel each time I think of the amount of time he has given to me — from his office, home, and even travels. Also, on his own he has taken time to think about issues of interest to me.""</p>
<p>Duffie is the James Irvin Miller Professor of Finance.</p>
<p>Citing educational value and quality of the learning experience, Sloan fellows honor a professor teaching one of the Sloan core courses. In nominating Ron Kasznik, pictured here, Sloan students said he taught ""in a comfortable and safe learning environment for those of us who thought accounting would be particularly challenging. He drew upon our experience and allowed us to learn from each other as well as him. Accounting is not usually considered to be interesting, memorable, and fun, but Professor Kasznik made it all of those."" Kasznik is an associate professor of accounting.</p>
<p>Feinberg teaches microeconomics, a required course for first-year students. He received his undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He served for two years on the faculty of Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University before coming to Stanford Business School in 1998.</p>
<p>In the 2003 nominations for the MBA award, the field was so strong, said Alexis Hanneken, who chaired the student-run MBA committee, that students named four honorable mentions for their strong teaching, preparation and forethought, energy and passion, and ability to engage students. The four faculty honored were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/h-irving-grousbeck"">Irv Grousbeck</a>, the MBA Class of 1980 Consulting Professor of Management</li>

Morgan, who served for nine years as a California State Senator and, later, as president and CEO of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, is the 29<sup>th</sup> recipient of the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award from the Stanford GSB Alumni Association.</p>
<p>A 1978 graduate of Stanford GSB, Morgan is the first woman to receive the school's highest honor, which is presented annually for exceptional leadership in the private and public sectors. Past recipients include former Secretary of State George P. Shultz (1987), author and Common Cause founder John Gardner (1993), and Chairman and Co-CEO of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles R. Schwab (1995). Last year's recipient was Lorenzo Zambrano, chairman and CEO of Cemex S.A.</p>
<p>In her remarks to an audience of students, alumni, and Silicon Valley executives at the April 13 Ernest C. Arbuckle Award Dinner at Hotel Sofitel in Redwood City, Morgan praised the school for its enduring commitment to equal opportunity and stressed the unique obligations that business leaders have to their communities.</p>
<p>She directed her closing comments at graduating students, urging them to find creative ways to make contributions to the public:</p>
<p>""I encourage you to take time during your remaining weeks in school to reflect on the type of person and type of professional you want to become. I hope you will choose to be men and women of principle who understand and act upon your unique obligations to your community and its institutions, regardless of where you settle.</p>
<p>""Each of you will find different ways to meet these obligations — some through money, others through time or ideas. Not every year, but often. The details are not necessarily important. But don't think for a minute that our prosperity can endure without the active efforts of people, like you, who enjoy the advantages of a fine education.</p>
<p>""Apathy may be easier. Convictions often have a high cost, but our communities need your contributions.""</p>
<p>A resident of Los Altos Hills, Morgan holds a bachelor's degree from Cornell University, and has served both as a Stanford University Trustee and on the Stanford GSB Advisory Council. She is on the Board of Directors of Cornell University, Pacific Gas & Electric Corp., Greater Bay Bancorp, and the American Leadership Forum. She served as a member of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors from 1981 to 1984 and the Palo Alto Board of Education from 1973 to 1978.</p>
<p>The Ernest C.Arbuckle Award, established in 1968, is named for the school's late dean who served from 1958-1968. The award honors men and women who ""by their actions have demonstrated notable excellence as professional managers who are committed to principle and have a continuing concern for and sensitivity to the changing needs of society"".</p>",,,309801,,,,Past Arbuckle Award Recipients,http://alumni.gsb.stanford.edu/events/arbuckle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Career & Success | Leadership,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,3985,2/1/06 0:00,Stephen Adams Honored with 2006 Arbuckle Award,46,news/headlines/2006arbuckleaward.shtml,MBA '62 alumnus shares his belief in value of business to society.,66,"<p>His business empire includes billboards, wine, banks, and a broad set of products and services for recreational vehicle users. The entire group of Adams Companies would rank 150 on the Forbes list of privately held firms if it were a single company, Stephen Adams told guests at the dinner honoring him as the 2006 Arbuckle Award recipient.</p>
<p>Like the man at the helm, Adams' companies keep an extremely low profile. The privately held firms have ""no need to beat the drum for Wall Street or whisper the earnings expectations for the next quarter. ""¦By and large, I have enjoyed and preferred to be below the radar screen and out of the public spotlight,"" said Adams, MBA '62, who was honored Feb. 15 as the 36th recipient of the top award presented by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association to an outstanding member of the Stanford GSB community.</p>
<p>Steady growth and long-term relationships are the key to success of his companies, said Adams. He bought his first outdoor advertising firm in 1983; started building the Affinity Group in 1989; purchased Affinity Bank in 1995, Adams Wine Group in 1996, and Freedom Roads RV dealerships in 2003.</p>
<p>""In other words: If it's good, stick with it,"" he advised.</p>
<p>Adams introduced the top leadership of several of his firms, including President Mike Schneider of the Affinity Group, who has been with the firm for 25 years, and Mike McGuire, who has been president of Affinity Bank for the 10 years it has been part of the Adams Companies.</p>
<p>Decrying business figures involved in ethical scandals, Adams argued that they have put self-interest first. Even among highly ethical leaders, Adams said, most increase their social consciousness at the point in their career when they undergo a transition from seeking business success to focusing more on ""using what has been accumulated for the right purposes,"" such as supporting charitable causes.</p>
<p>""Helping others not so fortunate as we is a just and noble cause, and now and into the future we will continue to find places and people"" to support with charitable gifts, he said.</p>
<p>Adams expressed his strong belief in the basic value of business to society and outlined how he chooses firms to include in his holdings. He pointed to the shiny red apple placed at each setting at the formal dinner. ""If you took this apple and carved it into four pieces - leaving the core as the fifth piece - you would have a presentation of my thinking about the basic business principles,"" Adams told the guests.</p>
<p>First, he said, the business should be in an industry with a fair degree of activity from buyers and sellers, allowing value to be established clearly.</p>
<p>Second, Adams called for investing in easily identifiable profit centers, ""without a lot of allocated or unallocated overhead and indirect costs.""</p>
<p>""Third, the investment should be able to attract a lineup of lenders. One lender doing a one-off financing is not enough. The multiple lenders will provide a fluid and liquid market for the investment when the time comes to buy or exit.</p>
<p>""Fourth, the opportunity should have many of the characteristics of a franchise; namely, protected territory, inelastic demand, unlevel playing field, and difficult barriers to entry. It should be more than a commodity but something that has true and continuing franchise value.</p>
<p>""And finally, I come to the most important part of the Adams Apple-the core; namely, the people part of the equation. There should be a vast source of qualified men or women from which to recruit. It can't be dependent on one person or a single entity. It needs a team and bench strength with more than one person running it. Usually the best management will be available and willing to move, given the right incentives and compensation plan.""</p>",,,,,,,Past Arbuckle Award Recipients,http://alumni.gsb.stanford.edu/events/arbuckle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,Leadership,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,3975,12/1/05 0:00,David Bradford Awarded Alumni Silver Apple,42,news/headlines/2005silverapple.shtml,"Bradford honored for his teaching in seminal course, Interpersonal Dynamics, known as ""Touchy Feely,"" and similar leadership workshops for alumni. ",147,"<p>The notion that people can be taught everything they need to know for the span of their professional lives in just two years is clearly false, said senior lecturer <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/david-l-bradford"">David Bradford</a>, a strong advocate of ongoing education throughout one's life. Bradford recently was awarded the 2005 Jaedicke Silver Apple Award for his outstanding service to the School's graduates by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association.</p>
<p>""The idea that you get educated once and then apply it forever might have worked one or two generations ago, but it is not going to work today,"" said Bradford, whose field is organizational behavior. ""Knowledge is generated at too rapid a pace, and conditions change too rapidly.""</p>
<p>Bradford praised the alumni association's Lifelong Learning program, headed by Erica Richter, and said he believes it should be expanded to include more types of continuing education for alumni. ""Lifelong learning is more than just attending a one-day seminar or a four-day residency, or even a two-week executive program,"" he said. ""Fundamentally, we need to rethink what people need throughout all the stages of their professional lives.""</p>
<p>The award, presented during Reunion Weekend, recognizes the contribution he has made through seminars and workshops delivered through alumni chapters both domestically and internationally. He also has taught courses through the Lifelong Learning program. The award is named for Robert K. Jaedicke, an emeritus dean of the School, and is presented annually to recognize a faculty member who contributes to programs aimed at alumni of the school.</p>
<p>Bradford is celebrated for his long-running MBA class on interpersonal dynamics - best known as ""Touchy-Feely"" - and also for an MBA class on high-performance leadership. Over the past few years he has taught a four-day seminar for alumni through the Lifelong Learning program. Called Interpersonal Dynamics for High-Performance Leaders, it combines the content of his two MBA courses and has been very well received by alumni.</p>
<p>Bradford says he sees differences between teaching MBAs and alumni who have learned more life lessons. ""If you live long enough, you realize that you can fall off the horse and get back on again,"" he said. ""I think many of our MBAs are very much afraid of failure. But those of us who have been around awhile realize that failure is inevitable, and what's important is how you handle it, not how you avoid it.""</p>
<p>There's also a greater appreciation among alumni for the ""softer"" managerial issues relating to people and interpersonal dynamics. ""MBAs are primarily focused on the technical courses, such as finance and accounting-which, of course, are very important,"" he said. But with experience comes the realization that although mastery of those functions are challenging, the more difficult problems tend to be human issues.</p>
<p>""There's often the attitude that if it weren't for people, organizations would be great places to work,"" said Bradford. ""Alumni tend to have had a great deal of experience with the complexity of human interactions. The discussions tend to be more sophisticated and nuanced as a result, and very personally rewarding.""</p>
<p>For alumni, participating in Bradford's courses can be very ""affirming."" Bradford stresses how too many managers use only a limited part of themselves in their jobs, and in the worst cases reject being themselves in favor of playing a role or presenting an image to those around them.</p>
<p>""This can be very limiting to one's efforts to be a leader,"" he said. ""One of the main messages the course delivers is that who you are is more powerful and useful than you might previously have thought."" This doesn't mean that managers should act on impulse; one has to be judicious and act appropriately, he said. ""But we can use more of ourselves and be more assertive and more vulnerable, and use our feelings and emotions in our work more than we think.""</p>
<p>The goal of the course, said Bradford, is to deliver the message that more authentic communication is a good thing. People are often afraid of being direct, yet that's what can help them build stronger work relationships and resolve interpersonal problems more easily and more quickly.</p>
<p>""The notion that I can be more myself-and more effective and influential and leaderlike in the process - is a deeply affirming one,"" said Bradford.</p>",,,302116,,,,Past Silver Apple Award Winners,http://alumni.gsb.stanford.edu/events/jaedickeaward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,Education,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,3876,9/15/02 0:00,Dean's Report to Alumni on the State of the School,50,news/headlines/2002deans_alumni_ltr.shtml,In September Dean Robert Joss wrote to alumni on the state of the school. Here is the transcript of his letter.,111,"<p>It is my pleasure each fall to report on the state of the school, to thank you for your ongoing support, and to keep you up to date on important events and work being done here. Like other individuals and institutions throughout the world, the Stanford Graduate School of Business has faced challenges in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to help our graduating students and alumni/ae find rewarding jobs in an atmosphere of serious economic upheaval. The importance of our alumni network took on new proportions last September in a time when maintaining contact with friends became of paramount importance. As a reflection of the current economic picture, this fall's incoming students present the greatest financial aid demand in the history of the school. Today our goals — to create leaders and ideas that improve management organizations, to encourage and support adherence to the highest ethical standards, and to support commitment to public and community service — have never been more important as we seek to help leaders as well as individual investors make smart choices about the future.</p>
<p>We continue to be optimistic about our nation, about the world economy, and about the school. In October, 2001 Dean Emeritus Mike Spence became the third business school faculty member to receive a Nobel Prize in economics when he and two academic colleagues were honored for work on signaling theory. The MBA Class of 2002 exhibited optimism last spring: A record 91 percent of the class pledged a precedent-setting $310,000 for the class gift to fund fellowships and expand the second-year seminars. And alumni support for the school remains high. Today's uncertain business climate makes this broad support base even more critical than in the past. We have realized a net growth of 11 faculty members in the past three years, including welcoming two senior professors and five other very talented junior faculty this fall.</p>
<p>At the program level, I am particularly enthusiastic about the activities of our new Center for Social Innovation (CSI) — created to promote management solutions to social problems through research, teaching, and outreach. Since the Public Management Program was founded in 1971, Stanford GSB has been a recognized pace setter in nonprofit leadership. While these decision makers face increasingly complex social problems, there has been little systematic research into the application of proven business and market solutions for social-purpose organizations. The new center will support academic study, including an annual Research Fellows Program to encourage some of the world's leading academics to focus on a specific topic selected each year. Work is also moving forward on a journal to explore both academic research and the ideas of practitioners working in the field of social innovation.</p>
<p>Led by Dale Miller, a social psychologist who joins us as the Morgridge Professor of Organizational Behavior, and faculty colleague James A. Phills Jr., the Center for Social Innovation currently has 17 faculty affiliates from the business school and other academic disciplines within the University. CSI has launched the Environmental Sustainability Initiative (ESI), founded on the tenet that the sustainability of our environment is integral to successful business. The center also has been the impetus for creating the Executive Program for Nonprofit Leaders, a two-week program for 48 participants whose attendance is significantly subsidized through the business school's CSI Fellowship program made possible by our center supporters.</p>
<p>Today, the school has a proven track record for successfully using the research center model to stimulate activities focused in certain areas. The Center for Entrepreneurial Studies (CES), created in 1996, has evolved into a model for bringing together research, teaching, and community engagement. All of the research centers foster interdisciplinary discussions and work among faculty, helping to generate new courses and cases, innovative approaches to research questions, and the collection and sharing of data that can open new avenues of discussion. Centers also bring together research associates, case writers, and other staff members to support faculty and activities such as speaker's forums and conferences.</p>
<p>When the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies was founded, debate raged whether entrepreneurship could be taught. Research by the Stanford Project on Emerging Companies analyzed the early growth of more than 170 Silicon Valley firms and produced ideas that showed the answer to be a resounding ""yes!"" The center also has brought business leaders and entrepreneurs into classrooms to teach collaboratively with tenure-line faculty, creating new synergies and new approaches to the issues facing young firms. Alumni/ae contributed to research in this area by responding to a 1997 questionnaire asking about their personal career trajectories. This data is now being mined by faculty members looking for answers to questions such as ""Are there identifiable characteristics shared by successful entrepreneurs?""</p>
<p>The Center for Electronic Business and Commerce was founded in 1999 to support research on the role and impact of the Internet. One of its founding goals was to integrate an understanding of the effects of electronic business and commerce into all aspects of the school's curriculum. That goal appears to be on target. Dozens of papers written by faculty from most of the school's major disciplines have focused on Internet-related topics, more than 50 new electronic business cases have been added to the school's collection, and researchers have created data partnerships with a variety of firms to fuel ongoing academic investigation. Work supported by the center has been integrated into a variety of classes such as Supply Chain Management and Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation.</p>
<p>In addition to fostering new research and courses, we are putting effort and resources into giving our graduates access to the latest ideas, trends, cases, speeches, and other activities at the school. I believe that the time spent here as a student is just the beginning of the learning process. Our Alumni Relations and Executive Education offices are key links in keeping you abreast of what is being discussed in classrooms today. Alumni/ae and guests are invited to Executive Forums, many of them held in cities outside the United States, and to Alumni-Faculty Seminars held on campus. Online resources are available through the Lifelong Learning page on the school's alumni website and include summaries and videos of campus speakers and conferences, as well as reading lists and examples of work going on in classrooms. Executive Education is developing multimedia CDs of faculty seminars that will include study questions, written materials, and reading lists. Watch for the monthly newsletter <em>@GSB Today</em> that summarizes recent events and provides links to Web-based resources.</p>
<p>The world today needs sound management in all its institutions — educated managers and intelligent, highly principled management teams provide much needed leadership. By generating research and insights that help to develop top managers in our MBA and Sloan programs, by reaching out to business leaders through executive education, and by offering lifelong learning to alumni/ae, we have an enormous impact on the world of management. I know you share my pride in the quality of work done here and in the graduates of our program, men and women whose success has contributed to the school's worldwide reputation and history of leadership. I invite you to continue to be an active part of this organization, to be involved in our programs, to use our online services, and to support our ongoing efforts to create leaders and ideas to meet the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p>By Robert Joss, Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean</p>",,,302296,,,,Stanford GSB Mission,stanford-gsb-experience/leadership,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,Economics | Organizational Behavior ,,,Center for Social Innovation | Center for Entrepreneurial Studies,,,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,3867,9/1/01 0:00,Dean's Letter to Stanford Business School Alumni/ae,51,news/headlines/2001deans_alumni_ltr.shtml,Robert L. Joss says the school is committed to maintaining a small student body size and highly personal experience for students.,129,"<p>At the beginning of my third year as dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, I am struck by the energy and excitement permeating this institution as reflected by the faculty, students, alumni/ae, staff, and other friends with whom I have been working.</p>
<p>We have made some important decisions about the school's long-range goals and are moving forward to reach those objectives. As I shared with you in the <a href=""/news/bmag/archive"">August issue</a> of <em>Stanford Business</em> magazine, feedback from our recent needs assessment reinforced my view that our intimate size is one of the key factors in the success of the school. After thoughtful consideration, we have made a commitment to remain relatively small, preserving the size of our MBA Program while expanding our Executive Education offerings.</p>
<p>Our mission — to be the world's leading school of management education — is clear. How to accomplish that mission and maintain the school's small size is our greatest challenge. We must continue our leadership in traditional academic fields and at the same time evolve our curriculum to embrace new ideas. To reach these goals, we look to our unique community of scholars, friends, and intellectual partners.</p>
<h2>Community Is the Lifeblood of the School</h2>
<p>I see our community as a living, active entity that sustains the school on many levels. The students, faculty, staff, graduates, friends, and other partners, such as the corporations that collaborate with us, infuse the school with new ideas and possibilities. We celebrate this sense of community at annual events, such as graduation, reunions, and conferences for alumni and business leaders. Our Alumni Relations team offers a variety of programs and services to reduce the geographic barriers that can hamper an ongoing relationship with the school. For instance, even if you can't attend the alumni conference in Hong Kong this year, you can get information about the speakers and the program through the website and can browse information on a variety of research topics or view videos of presentations by faculty or visitors. To continue to meet the needs of alumni, Alumni Relations recently launched an improved version of the database, which provides facilitated networking and career services, including a new Global Workplace job search engine.</p>
<p>We are working hard to build community to benefit the school, our students, and the world around us. That means helping our current students look beyond their two years here to recognize the contributions of those who came before them and their own role in building the school's future. It also means convincing our entire community to take ownership of the school's mission by contributing to case studies and other research, meeting and mentoring current students, collaborating with faculty in teaching, or taking an active role in alumni programs.</p>
<p>In addition to soliciting direct feedback, we monitor public perceptions, such as those reflected in rankings reported by magazines and newspapers. As an example, last spring one poll reported recruiter dissatisfaction that we believe was sparked partially by the stiff competition for highly qualified job candidates in a tight labor market. While we cannot control market forces, we are working to improve recruiters' experiences at the school. We also need you to express how much you value your business school experience by responding to surveys, supporting research and networking efforts, and participating in annual giving so that others may continue to benefit from the type of experience that previous generations made possible for you.</p>
<h2>Renewed Focus on the Student Experience</h2>
<p>One issue that seems to unite alumni and alumnae from all classes is the desire to sustain a positive student culture that combines high achievement with mutual support. We pride ourselves on the intimate nature of the MBA experience, particularly on the collaborative spirit that underlies our teaching and learning. Students not only become members of a specific MBA or Sloan class but also help shape the institution for those who follow. To encourage this process, we involve alumni in many aspects of student life; they now interview applicants and are scheduled this fall to take part in MBA orientation activities by attending dinners and leading discussion groups. Our goal is to help students understand both the benefits and the responsibilities that come with joining the Stanford GSB community.</p>
<h2>Investment in Academic Resources</h2>
<p>To maintain our high academic standards in this ever-changing environment, we must invest more in teaching, research, case studies, and course development. I believe we must increase the size of the faculty to ensure a comprehensive curriculum and research agenda and to provide depth by nurturing junior faculty members for our future. Increased efforts to build capacity met with success as we welcome 12 new faculty members this year, bringing our total tenured and tenure-track positions to 94.</p>
<p>We continue to realize benefits from existing academic centers and are launching others to focus research and teaching in specific areas and to increase interdisciplinary collaboration within the school and across the University. We are raising funds for the new <a href=""/csi/"">Center for Social Innovation</a>. In addition to focusing research and teaching on issues of nonprofit management, the center sponsored 48 nonprofit leaders in the new Executive Program for Nonprofit Leaders this summer and provides outreach through the Public Management Program, Alumni Consulting Teams (ACT), and community programs.</p>
<p>By reaching out to new audiences, we strive to increase our global impact. We are exploring ways to expand our Executive Education efforts, both through traditional classroom offerings and through electronically mediated learning, which will enable us to reach a wider audience by combining the best of a campus experience with learning online. We also are exploring new types of partnerships, such as the executive program Leading Change and Organizational Renewal, taught jointly this fall for the first time by our faculty and Harvard Business School faculty.</p>
<h2>Implications of Our Financial Model</h2>
<p>Our size, which is one of our strengths, is also a constraint — especially given our aspirations to excellence. We are known as a formula school, affiliated with and very much a part of Stanford University yet financially independent. We are responsible for funding our entire operation, as well as contributing our share to cover University expenses. Our annual operating budget has doubled in only five years to more than $90 million. Of that, just over half is generated through tuition and fees. About one quarter is covered by income from our endowment, and the remainder — an ambitious $20 million this year — must be raised annually through gifts from our alumni/ae, friends, foundations, and corporations.</p>
<p>This is a tall order. We need to increase the number of alumni/ae participating in annual giving each year, as well as the level of their gifts if we want to continue making the investments in research, education, people, and programs that are necessary to maintain the standard of excellence for which the Stanford MBA, PhD, Sloan, and SEP programs are known.</p>
<p>These investments in faculty, research, and technology are much like those you make for your retirement. We must invest aggressively now in the education of our students to see the returns later in the school's enhanced ability to affect the world's thinking about important business issues. Our graduates have the capacity to change their organizations, their communities, and the world.</p>
<p>The Stanford Graduate School of Business is recognized worldwide as a symbol of quality, producing research and graduating leaders who have an important effect on the business world. It was this reputation that attracted you to the school. To maintain it, we need to keep up the tradition of intellectual engagement and financial support among our community today. Our ambitions to impact the world of management may overshadow our small scale, but, with the efforts of the entire GSB community, our goals are achievable. That makes mine the most exciting job around!</p>

1,4187,9/1/07 0:00,Welcome to the MBA Class of 2009,32,news/headlines/classof2009_mba.html,"Students come from nearly five dozen countries and include an avocado farmer, two bodyguards, and investment managers, among others.",132,"<p>They come from 54 countries, have worked in more than 60 industries, and include former managers, reporters, bodyguards, a sixth-generation avocado farmer, and the national flamenco champion of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Members of the Stanford Graduate School of Business MBA Class of 2009 began their journey this week with a welcome from Assistant Dean and MBA Admissions Director Derrick Bolton, MBA '98, who praised their accomplishments and diverse backgrounds while urging them to take full advantage of opportunities on the Stanford campus.</p>
<p>""In a word, Wow!"" Bolton told the 362 new students in his welcome speech September 17. ""There were 5,700 applicants who wanted to sit where you are today. We offered admission to about 8 percent of applicants, which again places Stanford among the most selective business schools in the world, and makes us the most selective school within our peer group.""</p>
<p>""For every seat in the class, there were 16 applicants,"" Bolton said. ""Virtually any of them would do anything to be sitting where you are today. To admit the class here today, we were also forced to turn away incredible people who, like you, have achieved amazing success in life and who have compelling prospects for the future … It is my goal to remind you of the incredible privilege you were given and the responsibility you accepted by joining the Stanford community. So with every decision that you make, please think not only of yourself and of your classmates, but also of the folks who would love to be in that seat today.""</p>
<p>Aside from the United States, members of the Class of 2009 come from nearly five dozen countries including Mexico, China, India, Canada, Turkey, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Bulgaria. Many of them worked in consulting, investment management, telecommunications and technology, and consumer-retail.</p>
<p>Others come from non-business backgrounds. Two provided bodyguard services — one at a private firm in New York City and the other in Iraq. One worked for the United Steelworkers Union, while another was a former game show production assistant on Irish television.</p>
<p>The Class of 2009 will also likely be known for its athleticism. Class members played in at least 29 intercollegiate sports including archery, baseball, basketball, water polo, and ultimate Frisbee. One class member has won two world champion gold medals in swimming while another is the national sailing champion of Chile.</p>
<p>The Class of 2009 will witness what promises to be the most exciting school year in recent memory as the Stanford Business School embarks on a new era highlighted by a fresh, bold approach to teaching management and leadership with a new curriculum.</p>
<p>For the first time in the Stanford Business School's history, students will receive personalized instruction and will be required to gain meaningful international experience during their studies either through a global study trip, overseas service-learning trip, or international internship.</p>
<p>David Kreps, senior associate dean for academic affairs, urged class members to savor the challenges and learning opportunities in the next two years.</p>
<p>""The goal here is to learn as much as you can,"" he said at the welcome assembly. ""You're here to become a general manager and leader.""</p>

1,4002,10/1/06 0:00,Summer Program Offers Grad Students a Mini-MBA ,47,news/headlines/2006sie.shtml,Summer Institute for Entrepreneurship (SIE) was created to teach business and entrepreneurial skills to non-business graduate students.,135,"<p>For Rong Xu, Stanford Graduate School of Business Summer Institute for Entrepreneurship was the answer to four years of searching. The biomedical informatics graduate student at the School of Medicine had made a point of taking business classes before — a seminar here and there — but she still aspired to learn more about how business really works. When she heard about the new program, she jumped at the chance to spend four weeks of her summer in the classroom. ""It changed my view of the business world, of what being a successful entrepreneur looks like,"" says Xu. ""The program taught me a lot.""</p>
<p>Xu and 69 other graduate students spent parts of June and July taking intensive courses in business disciplines and designing new ventures together in the first Summer Institute for Entrepreneurship (SIE). Created to help further Stanford President John Hennessy's goal of fostering more interdisciplinary graduate student education, SIE was designed and launched by Business School faculty and staff in less than a year.</p>
<p>Based in part on the School's existing summer business program for undergraduates — the two-year-old Summer Institute for General Management — SIE introduced important changes, says the program's academic head, Professor Garth Saloner, one of 14 faculty members who designed the institute and taught its students. Saloner is the Jeffrey S. Skoll Professor of Electronic Commerce, Strategic Management, and Economics. He also is director of the Business School's Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. The undergraduate summer program is built around basic business management. The program targeting graduate students adds a segment on entrepreneurship and business growth.</p>
<p>Though the new program is open to non-Stanford applicants, in its first year all but three student participants in SIE were from Stanford. Thirty-five were PhD students, nine were medical students, and twenty-three were master's or recently graduated master's students. They hailed from engineering and the life sciences, as well as from earth sciences and other science and social science disciplines.</p>
<p>""Students in those parts of the university either go on to take non-academic jobs — going into industry — or they go into academia, but within academia, they advise and mentor students who themselves go off and start businesses and go into young ventures,"" Saloner says. ""The idea was to give people like that an introduction to business and management, so that we could help them jumpstart the process that otherwise takes place in on-the-job training.""</p>
<p>Students came away satisfied: On a five-point scale, they rated the program a 4.6. For the next session, set to begin June 18, 2007, Saloner says program leaders plan to recruit students from the other schools and disciplines, such as law, education, and the humanities.</p>
<p>How much can students learn in a month? Classes met every day, with three or four one-hour sessions, and, according to Saloner, students caught on fast to a wide range of business disciplines and skills. ""The first two-thirds of the program is really a kind of mini-MBA,"" he says, covering topics such as finance, marketing, accounting, and business strategy. The last portion of the month is spent on how to start a new business and grow it. Along the way, students learn ""soft skills"" such as public speaking, leadership, and networking — which for some are just as important as discerning data points on a spreadsheet. ""I learned lot of social skills, like networking, which is exactly what I want and need,"" says Xu.</p>
<p>To facilitate students learning from one another, they were broken up into interdisciplinary study groups. Organizers rearranged student seating once a week so that participants could maximize the number of contacts they made.</p>
<p>For some, the network of people they met may be the most lasting benefit. Katherine Murray, a third-year PhD student in the Department of Communication, knew only two out of 70 students going into the program. ""It was this vast group of PhD students, people I'd never had the opportunity to cross paths with before,"" she says. ""Now I have an extended network of people I can bounce ideas off of.""</p>
<p>The program also gave students the chance to see real entrepreneurs at work. Participants took field trips to visit six new ventures where they were greeted by CEOs who revealed the companies' inner workings. Students got an insider's view of a full range of startups — including one that had been sold shortly before they arrived to visit. Employees were busily packing up but still stopped to offer encouragement to students. Indeed, one key lesson, Saloner points out, is that while starting a business is risky, it is not career-ending if the company does not take off or is sold.</p>
<p>In the final portion of the program, students presented their ideas for new ventures to an audience of alumni, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. ""One of the great things about this university is the extraordinary range of technologies that are being developed in the labs,"" Saloner says. Many of the students' business plans were based on ideas from their lab research; some seem readily commercializable, adds Saloner. Of the 14 concepts presented, ""there were easily four or five new ventures that could be successful.""</p>
<p>Xu's project was a health search engine. She came away with some surprises. ""Before, I thought, I'm going to build the coolest thing in the world and people will come to me — but it's totally different,"" she explains. ""It's not about your technology — you could have the coolest thing, but you need to reach people through marketing. You need to get your product out, to get people to use it,"" she says.</p>
<p>David Klaus, a graduate student in mechanical engineering at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford's School of Engineering, came away with a similar lesson. Klaus hopes to develop affordable tools for developing countries such as Myanmar. One product he has created is an irrigation pump that uses minimal amounts of metal, instead employing native materials such as bamboo to keep costs low. He knew he needed business knowledge to back up his design expertise. ""I realized that in the travels I've done in developing countries it's not enough just to have a good product, to make a product that works well. You have to have the business skills to get it out to people, to market it, to develop a supply chain. If you don't have that, your product just sits in your garage,"" he says.</p>
<p>For Klaus, SIE was ""a very eye-opening experience."" At times, confronting the realities of starting a business was ""sort of scary and uncomfortable."" But knowledge is power: ""I need to understand these things and how to leverage them if I'm really going to do something that's going to be productive and beneficial to other people,"" Klaus says. He has since traveled to Myanmar and launched two of his product ideas — including the water pump — into full-scale production.</p>
<p>For some students, the program fueled their motivation to form their own companies. Many feel that the training will serve them well in any leadership position. ""There is a great need for people in leadership to have a basic understanding of business skills — how to read a budget sheet or to do long-term projections,"" says Murray from the Department of Communication. ""I went in to learn a certain set of skills and I absolutely feel that I got that. It was a perfect, really intense month of introductory work in accounting, finance, and entrepreneurship.""</p>

1,12901,4/16/12 0:00,Former Dean Honored for Leadership,34,news/headlines/joss-arbuckle-award.html,"Robert L. Joss is the 42nd recipient of the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award, which recognized important changes during his 10 years as dean.",133,"<p>When global banker Robert L. Joss became dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1999, the school's current tagline — Change lives. Change organizations. Change the world. — did not exist. By the time he stepped down from that position in 2009, it had become a well-established articulation of the school's vision and direction for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>Joss' 10 years of leadership at Stanford GSB helped move the school forward in fulfilling that vision. Among other accomplishments, his tenure oversaw the funding and planning for construction of the 360,000-square-foot Knight Management Center that opened in 2011 and the development of a new MBA curriculum under the direction of now Dean Garth Saloner. Joss established greater collaboration with other schools at Stanford to encourage multidisciplinary learning. On March 12, 2012, he was recognized for these contributions, among others, as the 42<sup>nd</sup> recipient of the prestigious Ernest C. Arbuckle award.</p>
<p>Sponsored annually by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association, the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award recognizes excellence in management leadership. The award was created in 1968 in honor of the late business school dean, whose name it bears. Recipients demonstrate a commitment to both managerial excellence and to addressing the changing needs of society.</p>
<p>Joss and ""Ernie"" Arbuckle had a long history together, dating back to Joss' time as a business school student at Stanford, when Arbuckle served as the dean. Arbuckle served as Joss' trusted mentor, advising him to pursue a prestigious fellowship at the White House and later recruiting him to work at Wells Fargo Bank. Joss spent 22 years at Wells Fargo, rising to the position of vice chairman, and subsequently became CEO of Westpac, one of Australia's largest banking groups.</p>
<p>When he was offered the job to become dean of Stanford GSB, Joss thought of his mentor and, as he reflected at the March awards ceremony, arrived at his decision. ""How wonderful it would be to serve the school [as Ernie had], and to be a part of that legacy,"" Joss told the audience of more than 400 attendees. ""The school had done so much for me — if I could draw on all my experiences since leaving, and somehow help make it an even better place, well what could be better than that? Few people ever get such a chance.""</p>
<p>A leader in global banking, a former U.S. Treasury Department official, and a Stanford Graduate School of Business MBA ('67) and PhD ('70), Joss was Stanford GSB's first dean from industry in 17 years. He brought with him seasoned business leadership skills, persistence, and integrity, all of which enabled him to launch a collaborative effort that would result in an innovative, cross-disciplinary curriculum; two new joint degrees; and the establishment of centers for Leadership Development and Research, Global Business and the Economy, and Social Innovation. Each center created a critical mass of case work, activities, and course support in their respective areas.</p>
<p>As dean, Joss also oversaw the planning and launch of fundraising to support Stanford GSB priorities as part of an unprecedented university-wide campaign, The Stanford Challenge. With his continued leadership, he helped the school raise $884 million for new endowed student fellowships and faculty positions; integrated multidisciplinary, curricular innovations with the school's centers; increased broad-based annual giving; and the construction of the Knight Management Center.</p>
<p>""Bob's life, his career, his contributions to Stanford and to the society at large have been nothing short of exceptional, and that, of course, is what the Arbuckle award is all about,"" observed Professor Emeritus George Parker during the event. ""As dean of the business school, Bob was a major change agent with a long list of accomplishments. At the end of his term as dean, it's safe to say that never has the business school been held in such high esteem across the rest of the campus.""</p>
<p>Today, Joss serves as Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean, Emeritus, at Stanford GSB, with teaching interests in general management and organizational leadership. He is currently a director of Citigroup, Bechtel Group, Makena Capital Management, and CM Capital; and is active in Australian-American affairs, serving as co-chair of the advisory board for the U.S. Studies Center at Sydney University. In 2001 he received the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society.</p>",,,302296 | 303071 | 302481,,,,The Joss Decade,stanford-gsb-experience/leadership/history/dean-robert-joss ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,Management | Leadership,,,,PhD,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,4325,4/1/08 0:00,"With 75 Years of Experience, The Library Looks Ahead",52,news/headlines/jackson_75.html,The first official GSB library didn’t formally open until 1933; it was tightly wedged into a portion of Jordan Hall that doubled as a classroom.,144,"<p>When Stanford GSB admitted its first students in the fall of 1925, there was no library just for them. The first official library dedicated to the GSB didn't formally open until 1933, tightly wedged into a portion of Jordan Hall that doubled as a classroom.</p>
<p>Some of the 1,000 books that lined the shelves in that 30-by-40-foot room probably came from J. Hugh Jackson, the Business School's second dean, who is believed to have donated a portion of his personal book collection.</p>
<p>Fast forward 75 years.</p>
<p>Today's two-story J. Hugh The Library — named in honor of its early benefactor who championed expanding the facility — is an important source of information for hundreds of students writing papers, faculty doing research, as well as alums and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs searching out industry information.</p>
<p>The Library celebrated its first 75 years with a program and reception on April 23, and today is preparing for the three-quarter century. Plans are being finalized for the new library structure that will be the centerpiece for the Knight Management Center, the $275 million Graduate School of Business campus expected to open sometime in 2010.</p>
<p>Once a place where patrons went to pull books off the shelves, libraries today have undergone dramatic changes into a world where much information is accessed remotely. In the 21st century, libraries find themselves serving an always-on world where people routinely seek information via the internet. So the Business School's new library will devote less space to physical collections of books and documents while significantly boosting the amount of information that's available electronically.</p>
<p>""When you say 'library,' people still tend to think of this storehouse that has a lot of physical books and journals in it, but that is not true any longer and is not going to be true in the future,"" said Kathy Long, the library's director. ""We will clearly still have a space for that, but libraries are more than that now. Our goal is to make sure we can deliver as much as we can to where our customers want it. This may be to their desktop, to their BlackBerry, or to their telephone. The role of the library is changing and shifting, but not diminishing.""</p>
<p>If University projections hold true, the library will report 104,000 walk-in visits by the end of the current school year, down about 58.4 percent from 1968, when Jackson reported 250,000 visits.</p>
<p>But digital use has climbed dramatically, nearly tripling in three years, reaching 557,379 visits during the academic year that ended in August 2007.</p>
<p>To meet this electronic demand, a major part of the library's strategy includes having more interactive web 2.0 technologies online so users can collaborate and share information. Think of spicing up the library's traditional offerings with blogs, social networking groups, and ask-a-question sessions where anyone in the Business School community, as well as library experts, can respond.</p>
<p>Several new, web-based services are being offered to appeal to tech-savvy users of the library's site.</p>
<p>In 2006, Jackson librarians posted their first video to YouTube, featuring professors Jeffrey Pfeffer, the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior, and Robert Sutton, professor of organizational behavior (by courtesy), discussing their book, Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths, and Total Nonsense: Profiting from Evidence-Based Management.</p>
<p>Putting postings on the popular video-sharing site can help introduce Stanford's faculty to the outside world, said Daphne Chang, the library's associate head of library technologies and technical services. ""We felt more and more people were looking for multimedia access to authors and having a video introduction to their book would be useful.""</p>
<p>Then there's the Jackson blog, launched two years ago to engage and connect with library customers and other GSB bloggers. It helps give the library site a more informal and lively personality, said Chang. Items are written by library staffers and cover recent business news, faculty research, and links to alumni blogs. Viewership is growing; between January and March of this year, the library blog had 23,900 visits, about 11 percent more than the service's first year.</p>
<p>""We want to have a platform to encourage student discussion, not just one-way communication,"" said Chang.</p>
<p>The prevalence of corporate reports and other business information online means fewer people are physically setting foot in academic libraries around the country, said Hal Kirkwood, past chair of the Special Library Association's Business and Finance Division. Like the library, many are instead adding study rooms, computer space, and installing big-screen televisions tuned to business news. Purdue University's library system is even considering setting up an outpost in Second Life, the popular online hangout.</p>
<p>""There is still a concept of the library as being 'The Third Place,' not the classroom and not where the students live,"" said Kirkwood, who is also coordinator of instruction for the Management and Economics Library at Purdue. ""Students like quiet places to do their research, but they also like to see and be seen. So, we want to make sure the library isn't a closed-off, separate entity.""</p>
<p>At the library, changes are already evident. You won't see expanses of shelved books when you walk in the front door, although many popular business titles are on display.</p>
<p>What really stands out is the Traders' Pit, an area featuring computers populated with information from financial data providers including Bloomberg, an electronic board listing the latest price of the NASDAQ and other stock market indices, and a widescreen television carrying financial news from CNBC.</p>
<p>A wing of group seminar rooms opened last year in space that previously displayed little-used books and other materials. No longer in the Library, those items have been moved 50 miles from the campus to a storage warehouse in Livermore. Since the first items were trucked out of the library in 2004, more than 100,000 books have been moved so far to Stanford Auxiliary Library 3 (SAL3), with more transfers to come.</p>
<p>A climate-controlled facility roughly half the size of the Stanford Stadium football field, SAL3 looks more like a Costco, with items on shelves stretching all the way up to super-high ceilings and accessible only by a mechanical lift.</p>
<p>Typically, books moved to off-site storage were published before 1995 and have not circulated in the past five years, Long said. Stored items can be retrieved for delivery to campus the next business day, but requests aren't that frequent.</p>
<p>As more items have been cleared out to make space for conference rooms and staff offices, Long said Jackson's reference collection has shrunk by about 50 percent during the past three years. The number of library items will drop by an additional 60 percent before the Library moves into its new home, she said.</p>
<p>While adapting to change, Jackson remains one of the top academic libraries in the country.</p>
<p>In 2006, the library received a Center of Excellence for Service award from the Special Libraries Association's Business and Finance Division. Modeled after the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards, the library group's award recognizes excellence in library and information practices. Services including FastJack—the Library's customizable web toolbar launched in 2004 that serves as a shortcut to catalogs, e-journals, and databases—made Jackson stand out.</p>
<p>The kind of information sought by the library patrons is wide-ranging. Students typically come in saying they're working on an assignment and need market research reports on that subject, Long said, while faculty usually want raw data to analyze.</p>
<p>Specifics are still being worked out about how the inside of the business school's new library will look.</p>
<p>Based on the latest development plan, here's what you might eventually see:</p>
<p>There won't be an entry gate, a change being considered to make the library appear more inviting and encourage more walk-in visitors from Stanford and beyond. Look for self-checkout. Already common in several Bay Area public library systems, self-checkout reduces demand on library staff. The current reference and information desks — now separate — will be combined into one help desk. At five stories — four above ground, one below — the library will be the tallest building in the new Knight Management Center campus.</p>

1,4456,2/27/02 0:00,"Ernest C. Arbuckle Award Acceptance Speech by John H. Scully, MBA '68",69,news/headlines/scully_arbucklespeech.shtml,"Alumnus reflects on his years at Stanford GSB, including thoughts on free markets, meritocracy and entrepreneurial spirit.",122,"<p>Chairman Stein, Dean Joss, fellow classmates, my son Peter and daughter Katie, my brother Vince, faculty, students and friends of the school!</p>
<p>I also want to thank classmate Reece Duca for his gracious introduction.</p>
<p>This is obviously an extraordinary honor for me, even though it is painfully clear that the selection committee must have run out of suitable candidates! It is also an overwhelming honor that the event sold out … but of course that may have had something to do with my offer to friends and classmates of an Arbuckle Award Dinner, all expense paid package to the Bay Area! This included a night at the Fairmont, a Pier 39 tour, bay cruise to Alcatraz, and $20 for Pier 39's video game parlor. Apparently, our stimulus package sold out the room, for which I am very grateful.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to thank my 38 fellow classmates who have made the trip, a number coming just for this event and taking red eye flights home. Besides, being what I might humbly describe as one of the school's most successful and supportive classes, the class of 1968 was also one of the youngest and best looking. In testimony to that, I would like to invite all members and spouses/guests of the class of 1968 to please stand and allow us to give them a big round of applause.</p>
<p>Our class has been graciously recognized on a number of fronts, but one aspect that has been seriously underreported is our contribution to the world of letters. Recently published works include Richard Rainwater's piece entitled ""Minimizing Hair Loss as Your Net Worth Soars."" Then you have Reece Duca's new thesis, ""Market Validation in the Donut Industry."" John Dawson has a new work following up on his smash success, ""Egalitarian Traditions at the Choate School."" His new piece is ""A Complete Review of the 200 year History of Business Ethics on Wall Street."" Actually this turned out to be a 3-page pamphlet. Shari and Garen Staglin had a recent article published in the Wine Spectator ""Water into Wine — Chateaux Desenex to Non-Believers."" Finally, there is the timeless classic by Bill MacDonald, ""Lubricants and You."" For those of you who don't know Bill, he is the CEO of the Houghton Co., the third largest manufacturer of lubricants in South Philadelphia. So … some things few of you knew about the Class of 1968.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject, I would also recommend the students in attendance tonight read my partner Bill Oberndorf's classic work published in 1978, the year I hired Bill upon his graduation from Stanford GSB. That was, of course, the timeless piece, ""The Fallacy of High Starting Salaries — You Too Can Live on Pennies."" See, I was very penurious then, a fact many of my friends here will vouch for.</p>
<p>I do want to say a few serious words about my experience here in 1966-1968. It was an extraordinary juxtaposition of a very prosperous economy but Vietnam-troubled period of political unrest, combined with a gathering at Stanford GSB of highly motivated young men (and it was 98% men and young, half of the class being right out of their undergraduate schools with an average age of 24). We were brought together to a school literally blossoming under the incredible leadership of Dean Ernie Arbuckle and the very talented faculty he had assembled, the likes of Professors Robichek, Bach, Horngren, and VanHorne. Leadership, one of my real interests and I know one of Dean Joss' great passions, was visible everywhere from our Dean, our professors and in my supercharged, entrepreneurial classmates. That hardest to teach and highly intangible subject — so key to managerial and organizational success seeped from the very pores of this place. What a time to be here!</p>
<p>There were certain core values that also marked the school:</p>
<p>First, a recognition that free markets allocate goods and services far more effectively then any fiat system, and that if you want to disturb market allocation you better have a very strong policy reason to do so.</p>
<p>Second, a strongly held view highlighted by Sir John Browne in his Arbuckle award speech last year, that meritocracy is the only valid sorting mechanism for recognizing talent.</p>
<p>Third, an uncompromising passion for entrepreneurial endeavor and the clear view that individual achievement and prosperity required no apology when it was born of new economic enterprise that created new jobs and new wealth.</p>
<p>Let me comment briefly on my own career. I like to think of my work and that of my fellow SPO Partners as merchant banking, where partners function as capital allocators. We do this both in our public security market activities and in our private equity deals. What we are attempting to do is to bring capital to managements that merit it in businesses that have outstanding characteristics. What you might ask, are these outstanding characteristics? We would include the following as highly attractive business characteristics:</p>
<p>Real franchises with uniqueness that create high barriers to entry by others Businesses that have significant market shares and pricing power Companies benefiting from a macro trend of long term and sustainable dimensions Businesses that have real cash earnings and distribute same with limited required maintenance capital expenditures Ventures that don't require financial engineering to be successful, they stand on their own merit</p>
<p>And once you join capital and people to these opportunities, you let talented managers run with the ball and don't micro manage.</p>
<p>I would also like to say a few words about community and giving back. I would add this as another core value of my 1968 classmates and those who taught us — strong commitment to taking whatever leadership and managerial skills we may have and spending some time employing them toward the public good. My strong passion for helping inner city youth, begun as an undergraduate tutoring 6th graders in Trenton, NJ, has found expression in the Making Waves Foundation I started in partnership with an African American minister in Richmond, CA, in 1989. We now tutor and mentor 325 children, whom we bring in at the outset of the fifth grade and stay with through college. Of our first high school graduation class of 30 students, 28 went to college including two to Stanford, three to Berkeley, three to other UC Schools, two to Morehouse, etc. This is, of course, vastly different from their peer group in Richmond, CA.</p>
<p>Currently we serve Richmond and San Francisco and will open next year in East Palo Alto. We hope eventually to serve 1,000 students throughout the Bay Area and share our model nationally with any interested and responsible parties. Founded in 1989 we made plenty of mistakes, but now feel we have evolved into a highly effective algorithm. Many of my classmates here tonight have joined in similar undertakings, and I would implore you in the room, with your incredible collective talents, to direct them to some degree toward giving back. Live a life that matters.</p>
<p>Finally, for the students here I ask you as you leave this beautiful place, Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA, early in the 21st Century, in this great country to remember why you came here. And I would suggest that was to learn, to lead, and to go forth to unabashedly, but properly pursue your individual prosperity and as a consequence to positively effect the lives of all you touch. I am deeply appreciative for this great honor, that I got the chance to go to the Stanford GSB, and that as many of my friends were able to be here tonight to share this really extraordinary honor.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>",,,,,,3875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,,,,Sculley Brothers,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,4033,6/1/10 0:00,Student Trip to Mexico Presents a Country of Contrasts,54,news/headlines/2010Mexico.html,An MBA student shares his observations from a study trip; these trips offer an intensive learning experience and support Stanford GSB's global curriculum.,149,"<p>For 44 Stanford Graduate School of Business MBA students, spring break in Mexico included meeting the world's richest man and spending an evening with a treasure hunter sitting on $300 million in gold. But I get ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Arriving in Mexico City, we quickly understood why our trip was themed: ""doing business in a city of contrasts."" Our hotel was situated in the upscale Polanco neighborhood, just a few blocks from a community of squat, bare houses where street vendors sold taquitos fried in converted oil drums. We drove through that poor area of the city to meet with the world's richest man, self-made billionaire Carlos Slim Helu. During his hour with us, the Mexican telecommunications mogul displayed an uncanny knack for statistics and a great memory. Discussing a 20-year-old deal, he was immediately able to recall any minor detail as though it had happened only yesterday.</p>
<p>About an hour into the meeting, Will Boenig, MBA '11, asked Helu about allegations that he has a monopoly on telecommunications in Mexico. He dismissed the question, saying that such claims were completely unfounded. We continued to debate that answer during our debrief.</p>
<p>Our second day included a meeting with Carlos Fernandez, the CEO of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo. The great nephew of the company's founder, Fernandez introduced us to the ubiquitous theme of family business in Mexico. He confronted the topic head on, saying at Modelo — maker of Corona, Modelo Especial, and other popular beers — family relationships do not exist within the brewery walls. We also met with Manuel Medina-Mora, MBA '76, chairman and CEO of Latin America and Mexico for Citigroup. He detailed the economic crisis and discussed how he reduced exposures in Mexico and Latin America to limit losses during the downturn. Because of his performance, rumors have spread that Medina Mora may be Citigroup's next CEO.</p>
<p>Our next meeting was with Fernando Alvarez, CEO of Compartamos Banco, a Mexican bank specialized in microfinance After studying the for-profit microfinance institution in class, we were excited to get a deeper look at the company and the ethical nature of its business. After the discussion with Alvarez, who described his firm as essentially a for-profit enterprise, we traveled to the outskirts of Mexico City to view how the company manages its weekly meetings with borrowers. In a half-built house in a poor village, my team met with a group from the bank's ""Credito Mujer"" or Womens' Credit program, which lends money to groups of between 10 and 30 women. Loans are made to women because they have significantly better risk profiles than men, we were told.</p>
<p>Compartamos has achieved a write-off ratio of around 3%. The firm offers free life insurance to those with an outstanding credit balance, which encourages its borrowers to keep at least a small balance. We also saw that the group loans create a social environment in which borrowers gather together each week to discuss their financial status, and we thought that members might be reluctant not to borrow because they would then leave the group. Sure enough, we learned that over 90% of borrowers renew their first loans immediately after repayment.</p>
<p>The lush green environment of Monterrey stood in contrast to the arid nature of much of Mexico, and the city's architecture and design were far more modern. There, we met with Alvaro Rodriguez, the founder of one of the few venture funds in the country. Because so many businesses are family-run and funded, it can be difficult for outside investors to buy stakes in businesses or participate in new ventures, he said. We also met with Lorenzo Zambrano, MBA '68, CEO of cement and building materials giant Cemex, who discussed the economic downturn.</p>
<p>After more meetings than we could count, we were at long last in the resort area of Playa Del Carmen, meeting with Roman Rivera Torres, one of the original developers in the Cancun area. Cancun itself is an important and extremely successful, joint initiative between private developers and the government, designed to generate revenues from tourism. More intriguingly, we heard Torres describe his discovery of the remnants of the S.S. Golden Gate, an American ship that caught fire and sank off Manzanillo, Mexico, in 1862 and is rumored to hold more than $300 million in gold. He has written a book about the find titled Legend of the Golden Gate.</p><p>By John Mullins, MBA Class of 2011</p>",,,,,,4637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Leadership,North America,,,MBA,,,,,Katie Pandes
1,4486,8/10/10 0:00,Srinivasan's Career in Marketing Science Commemorated,53,news/headlines/srinivasan_3_10.html,"Internationally known for his work on consumer choice and sales force compensation, Seenu Srinivasan is also revered as a teacher and mentor.",140,"<p>His first doctoral student, Barnett Parker, calls him a ""guru,"" and the Pfeffer University professor doesn't use the term lightly. Indeed, for Seenu Srinivasan, the Indian-born professor who has become a legend and a beloved mentor in the field of marketing science, the much-overused Sanskrit moniker seems particularly apt.</p>
<p>""He's a great teacher, and of more than marketing. He's influenced me more than almost anyone else in my life,"" an admiring Parker shared with colleagues at a tribute to Srinivasan held in March at the business school, where the Adams Distinguished Professor of Management is retiring after serving on the faculty for 36 years. ""He has an aura about him. And,"" Parker said with a chuckle, ""he's the only person I'd consider flying out to honor at my own expense without a second thought.""</p>
<p>Parker is not alone in his sentiments. Srinivasan's colleagues and students are as apt to call the prolific scholar a generous, loving father figure as they are to brand him a brilliant thinker and a stickler for detail. His interest in the well-being of others is reflected in his approach to marketing, which has focused on trying to understand consumer preferences. Skip the hard sell and the advertising spin, his long string of award-winning articles has advised. If you build it — just the way people want — the sales will come.</p>
<p>Srinivasan is a key architect, along with Professor Emeritus Paul Green of Wharton, of conjoint analysis, a term they coined in 1978 to describe a technique that allows companies to predict which, among several products or services with multiple attributes, customers are likely to select. They ask consumers to rank-order a list of product attributes such as price, size, safety, ease of use, durability, and then use selective paired comparisons of attributes to infer quantitative measures of importance.</p>
<p>So useful has the survey-based research approach become for product planning that every year brings more than 10,000 commercial applications. Conjoint analysis also is used in contexts broader than the term ""marketing"" suggests. It has been applied to determine preferences for health care facilities, methods of transportation, and even political candidates.</p>
<p>Srinivasan has written about strategic portfolio planning, market structure and segmentation, and brand equity. He also coauthored studies of salesforce compensation, which showed that more volatile industries should rely more heavily on salary in their compensation plans rather than commission. As salespeople face more stable, predictable markets, however, they will be more motivated by a higher percentage of commission and less straight salary.</p>
<p>Another of his models can help a manager figure out how much more the company will earn from investing in various kinds of branding activities. For instance, he and his coauthors estimated that in the Korean cellular telephone market, Samsung gained $127 million dollars because of its increased brand awareness, improved perception of voice quality, and other factors. It's a significant contribution in a field in which the best that most marketers offer is a measure of consumers' image of a brand, not the dollars-and-cents effect of that image.</p>
<p>Born Venkataraman Srinivasan in a small town in southern India in 1944, Srinivasan was a Brahmin, an Indian of the highest caste that for centuries had been the administrative elite. The creation of the Indian republic unleashed resentment toward these former leaders and Srinivasan found himself the victim of a backlash of caste prejudice. Although he was a top student at his high school, he was denied entry into all engineering colleges in his native state of Madras (now called Tamil Nadu). Eventually, he was able to gain admittance to the Indian Institute of Technology, where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering and received a gold medal as the top student in his graduating class.</p>
<p>A Bombay engineering firm introduced him to production planning and management, which led him to enroll in industrial administration at Carnegie Mellon. He joined the faculty of the University of Rochester and was recruited to Stanford by business school Professor David Montgomery. The GSB promoted him to full professor after just two years.</p>
<p>The marketing industry has showered Srinivasan with 22 awards and accolades, including the Parlin and Converse awards for outstanding contributions to research, and the Churchill Award for lifetime achievement.</p>
<p>""Seenu has won almost every major award the marketing profession can convey,"" said his former roommate and frequent collaborator Allan Shocker, a professor emeritus of the University of Minnesota, yet he remains a ""genuinely nice person. I've seen him critique others' papers at conferences, for example, and he always takes care to do it in a way that's not insulting. Rather, his comments, often phrased as questions, can be said to be educational.""</p>
<p>GSB marketing Professor Jim Lattin says Srinivasan created ""an environment of collaboration"" at the business school by turning numerous doctoral students into close research associates. As the director of the doctoral program from 1982 to 1985, he played a key role in having PhD candidates do more research and less structured coursework. Eight of his doctoral students have won top awards for their dissertations or dissertation-based papers.</p>
<p>Oded Netzer, PhD '04, Srinivasan's most recent doctoral student, gives one reason why: ""When you speak with Seenu, you feel like he's the smartest person around and you're the second smartest. He leads you with, 'What you probably meant to say was ""¦' until you don't know which idea was his and which was yours. Yes, you come out of the meeting feeling very intelligent.""</p>
<p>Srinivasan's penchant for collegiality was also evident in the innovative course Integrated Design for Marketability and Manufacturing, which he co-created in 1991. For the past 19 years, courses that grew from that first course have trained Stanford engineering and MBA students to get beyond ""gearhead"" and ""bean counter"" stereotypes and work together to create products that both suit the leanings of designers and make sense in the market. The course, designed with then GSB Professor Bill Lovejoy and engineering Professor Dave Beach, had competing teams of students get down and dirty building product prototypes and conducting conjoint analyses to assess the market share potential of different design ideas. Srinivasan stepped away from the course in 2001, and since then it has morphed into business school Professor James Patell's Design for Extreme Affordability course under the auspices of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.</p>
<p>Srinivasan also is heavily involved in his native country. With his brother, Balachandran, an accounting professor emeritus from the Kellogg School of Management, he has served on the academic advisory boards of the Great Lakes Institute of Management in Chennai and the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. He has been faculty advisor to the GSB's collaborative MBA course with the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. In 2006, the Great Lakes Institute created the Kotler-Srinivasan Centre for Research in Marketing, named after him and Kellogg Professor Philip Kotler.</p>
<p>Retirement Srinivasan-style will include involvements both in India and Stanford. ""I plan to do some research and consulting, teach in a couple of Indian MBA programs, and also become a student again, attending some Stanford courses in human biology, philosophy, macroeconomics — subjects I know very little about,"" he said last spring. He will teach conjoint analysis in the doctoral program at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. ""I'm looking forward to contributing to management education back in the country where I was born,"" he said.</p>",,,302631 | 302441 | 302351 | 302486,Journal Article,329816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,Marketing,,,,,MBA,,,,,Helen Chang

Parker Professor of Finance and Economics at Stanford GSB, has been appointed to a two-year term on the newly-formed <a href=""http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2011/pr11099.html"" target=""_blank"">Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee</a> of the <a href=""http://www.fdic.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</a>, beginning in June 2011.</p>
<p>An independent agency created by Congress to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's financial system, the FDIC insures deposits in banks and thrift institutions; identifies, monitors and addresses risks to the deposit insurance funds; and limits the effect on the economy and the financial system when a bank or thrift institution fails.</p>
<p>The FDIC established the System Resolution Advisory Committee to address Dodd-Frank Regulatory Reform Rules in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. According to the Congressional charter inaugurating the body, ""The SR Advisory Committee will provide advice and recommendations on a broad range of issues regarding the resolution of systemically important financial companies?""</p>
<p>Admati recently rallied prominent financial economists to argue that Basel III capital regulation rules are insufficient to prevent future crises, and in fact maintain distortions in the financial system. A paper she coauthored makes the case that dramatically reducing the leverage of financial institutions would generate significant benefits while having minimal, if any, negative consequences for the economy.</p>
<p>Among the 18 members of the FDIC advisory committee are former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, and former Citigroup Chairman and CEO John S. Reed.</p>

1,4121,6/1/07 0:00,ACT Celebrates 20 Years of Pro Bono Service,43,news/headlines/act_anniversary.shtml,Stanford GSB alumni use their skills to help struggling nonprofits.,67,"<p>If fan mail is any measure, the Stanford Alumni Consulting Team (ACT) is a rock star.</p>
<p>Founded 20 years ago by Stanford GSB alumni bent on using their skills to help struggling nonprofits, ACT has since grown to involve more than 1,000 MBAs, who dispense $2 million in free management consulting services each year. That translates into a lot of thank you notes, said Dean Robert Joss, who helped celebrate ACT's 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary at a banquet May 24.</p>
<p>""I get more nice letters about ACT than anything I do as dean,"" he said. ""It is really tremendous. It makes the job worthwhile.""</p>
<p>The rest of the school enjoys the ""reflected glory"" of ACT, he said. ACT assembles teams of Stanford GSB graduates to tackle specific problems nagging at nonprofits. An arts organization might need a strategic plan. An international aid group might be looking to buttress the passions of a charismatic founder with the stability of a board and executive director. Nonprofits pose problems and alumni teams descend, helping struggling organizations right themselves in about six months.</p>
<p>Before ACT came along, businesspeople had few ways to donate high-level skills to community organizations on a short-term basis. Doctors and lawyers had well-established traditions of pro bono work, but if an executive wanted to volunteer, he or she wouldn't likely have the opportunity to use business expertise.</p>
<p>""Even if you were a VP of a bank you often still licked postage stamps,"" said Debbie Cohen, MBA '87, who wrote a business plan for ACT during her second year in business school. ""I wanted people to feel that their time, skills, and effort were working towards larger community goals.""</p>
<p>She gathered a group of alumni to do a pilot project for San Francisco Performances, a nonprofit arts organization that wanted to find out more about its audience and how best to reach it. One of Cohen's collaborators was Alison Elliott, MBA '84, who had also been toying with the idea of pro bono consulting. The project was a success, and soon ACT had a steering committee of Stanford alumni.</p>
<p>""It was really like a startup in a lot of ways,"" Elliott recalled.</p>
<p>ACT's supporters worked project to project, scrounging for money but never for volunteers. They spent years lobbying the school to take them in and give them a budget. ACT affiliated with the Stanford GSB Alumni Association in 1991, and became a part of Stanford GSB in 1998.</p>
<p>Even in the early years, when money was tight and Cohen was pulling all-nighters to write grant proposals, the organization never had to scrounge for enthusiastic Stanford graduates. ""It feeds people's souls in a way their regular full-time job often doesn't,"" Cohen said.</p>
<p>It is also a manageable commitment, asking volunteers to spend about 10 hours a month on a specific project that can be completed in six to nine months. They bring their expertise to questions of finance, information technology, retail, marketing, operations, fundraising, organizational development, real estate and planning.</p>
<p>ACT consistently attracts alumni of all ages; current volunteers hail from the Class of 1949 to the Class of 2007. That's one of the things that Ed Best, BS '58, MBA '60 and ACT's Exceptional Achievement Award winner this year, likes about ACT.</p>
<p>""I've done a whole lot of projects, and most all of them have been really attractive and really exciting to me, whether it's the client, the team, the subject or just the studies that were done,"" he said.</p>
<p>Best has participated in 21 projects, leading 13 of them. One project assisted the Oakland Zoo in analyzing whether housing pandas would help the zoo's bottom line. Best has worked with the World Affairs Council of Northern California and Children's Fairyland in Oakland. He also helped a children's policy organization figure out how to measure the results of its advocacy.</p>
<p>""Intellectually, that was an extremely challenging project,"" he said.</p>
<p>Cohen served as a volunteer on an ACT project to help San Francisco's Glide Memorial Church launch a computer training program for homeless people. She was executive director of ACT with a full-time job in management consulting at the time, and the project reminded her why she started ACT in the first place. She was forced to confront the number of people who live paycheck to paycheck, and how a spate of bad luck-a health crisis, a job loss-can put a person out on the street. She was able to leave ""the well-heeled affluent areas of the Peninsula [and go] to the tenderloin of San Francisco to see what people's lives were like,"" she said.</p>
<p>""It could have been me had I had different parents and grown up in a different environment,"" she said. ""It could be any of us.""</p>
<p>ACT at 20 has enriched hundreds of nonprofits, including A Home Within, a mental health organization that helps children in foster care. A Home Within's Executive Director Toni Heineman, spoke at ACT's anniversary banquet, recounting the painful process of building a new organization. A Home Within needed to settle on a mission and figure out how to make it scalable, and Heineman credited ACT's ""sometimes painful and unwanted advice"" with the organization's ""increased clarity, efficiency and impact.""</p>
<p>""We are better for our association with you,"" she said. And ""we are just one example.""</p>

1,3952,6/11/05 0:00,Stanford Business School Salutes the Close-knit Class of 2005,61,news/headlines/2005commencement.shtml,During Stanford GSB’s 80th commencement Dean Robert Joss paused to remember two tragedies during the academic year.,110,"<p>During the 80<sup>th</sup> commencement of Stanford Graduate School of Business, Dean Robert L. Joss acknowledged the record-breaking class gifts of the MBA and Sloan Master's Program classes of 2005.</p>
<p>Joss presided over the diploma ceremony that honored the 451 individuals awarded degrees this academic year. Stanford GSB conferred 373 Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees, 2 of them joint degrees with Stanford's School of Law, and 9 of them joint degrees with Stanford's School of Education. Eighteen students received doctorates, six received a Master of Arts in Business Research degree, and 54 graduates of the Stanford Sloan Master's Program received the Master of Science in Management degree.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Joss paused to remember two tragedies during the academic year. ""While this is an occasion of celebration and joy, it's also an occasion of remembrance and sadness,"" said Joss. ""We're particularly sad today, for all of us are missing an MBA classmate, James Hsu, who was sadly taken from us during the Boxing Day tsunami off the coast of Thailand."" Joss also remembered the MBA student from the University of California, Irvine, who died during a business schools charity event held at Stanford.</p>
<p>The tsunami tragedy also had an impact on this year's Ernest C. Arbuckle Award recipient, Bryan Pallop Gaw, who received the award from Susan Arbuckle, youngest daughter of the former dean of Stanford GSB. ""This award is the student body's way of honoring that individual who has shared with them a unique blend of activism and character,"" said Arbuckle. Gaw served on the Global Management Program leadership team and the admissions advisory council, and volunteered with the class gift effort. Gaw also led the December study trip to Singapore and Thailand and was heralded for ""his unselfish and determined efforts in search and rescue in the aftermath of the tsunami,"" Arbuckle said.</p>
<p>""This year is remarkable in that more than 80 percent of the class cast votes [for the Arbuckle award], resulting in the highest level of participation and the closest vote in a long time,"" said Arbuckle. ""Both points reveal the quality of ties members of this class have with each other, and the quantity of people who have made a very lasting impact.""</p>
<p>This close-knit bond was also evidenced in the record-breaking class gifts raised by this year's MBA and Sloan students. As of graduation day, an unprecedented 94 percent of the 2005 MBA Class raised more than $407,321 and exceeded the previous record by nearly $100,000.</p>
<p>The Stanford Sloan Master's Program, in its third year of class giving, also demonstrated a commitment to the School through its fundraising. One hundred percent of the Class of 2005 Sloan students participated to raise $57,058 for the Sloan Endowment Fund. ""We are deeply grateful and appreciative"" of the classes' collective generosity, Joss said.</p>
<p>Of the MBA graduates, 37 achieved distinction as Arjay Miller Scholars. Named in honor of the fourth dean of Stanford GSB, who was on hand to personally congratulate them, Arjay Miller Scholars are ranked in the top 10 percent of their class by academic performance.</p>
<p>At the top of the class, Sam D. Yagan was named the Henry Ford II Scholar and presented with a check for $15,000. The Chicago native and Internet entrepreneur majored in applied math as an undergraduate at Harvard University. In an unusually tight contest, MBA classmate Virginia DeJesus-Rueff was recognized as having come ""as close to second place as any of us in the dean's office can recall,"" said David Kreps, senior associate dean for academic affairs. DeJesus-Rueff earned her undergraduate degree in economics from Dartmouth College.</p>
<p>Finance faculty selected Simon I. Patterson to receive the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance, for excellence in coursework in the discipline. Patterson holds an undergraduate degree in archaeology and anthropology from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Special recognition was given to graduates who took on extra coursework to complete the certificate program in Global Management, dedicated to global issues and international business. Among the 130 recipients, 17 Sloan fellows received certificates. Similarly, certificates of completion were awarded to 52 MBA and 6 Sloan graduates who passed the course of study in the Public Management Program, created under the leadership of Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller in 1971 to train leaders for the public sector.</p>",,,302296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,,,,,,,,,,Helen Chang
1,4637,5/15/08 0:00,CEMEX CEO Lorenzo Zambrano Honored for Excellence in Leadership,63,news/headlines/zambrano-excellence-award.html,The Stanford GSB Alumni Association recognized Zambrano (MBA '68) for his role in transforming Mexico-based CEMEX into a global powerhouse.,139,"<p>Lorenzo Zambrano, who transformed the Mexico-based cement firm CEMEX from a domestic player into a global powerhouse that is now one of the world's largest suppliers of building materials, has been awarded the Stanford Graduate School of Business Excellence in Leadership Award from the Stanford GSB Alumni Association.</p>
<p>Business School Dean Robert L. Joss presented Zambrano with the award during a gala dinner held May 15 at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey. Zambrano is a member of the museum's board of directors. ""I am proud of the accomplishments of all our alumni,"" said Joss. ""It gives me special pleasure to recognize Lorenzo for both his strategic leadership of CEMEX and his understanding of the importance of corporate social responsibility in the global communities his company serves.""</p>
<p>Zambrano, who earned a BS in mechanical engineering from Tecnológico de Monterrey, is a 1968 MBA graduate of the Business School. He joined CEMEX in 1968 and has been the company's chief executive since 1985.</p>
<p>During Zambrano's first year as CEO, CEMEX revenues were approximately $276 million. After the acquisition of two major cement firms in Spain in 1992, CEMEX expanded its operations throughout Latin America, the United States, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Australia. In 2005, the company boosted its international market presence further with the purchase of UK-based cement maker RMC Group, and in 2007 CEMEX completed the acquisition of Australia-based Rinker, its largest ever.</p>
<p>Today CEMEX produces, distributes, and markets cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and related building materials to more than 50 countries. The Mexican firm is one of the world's largest building materials suppliers and the third largest cement producer. Last year's revenues topped $21.7 billion.</p>
<h2>Leader in Promoting Environmental and Social Programs</h2>
<p>In addition to shepherding the company's evolution from a regional supplier to a global leader, Zambrano has dedicated significant company resources to initiatives that preserve and support communities in which the firm operates. He made conservation a priority by helping to establish El Carmen, a wilderness preserve located near the Mexico-U.S. border that is home to deserts, grasslands, forest, and other biologically diverse ecosystems. ""As a result of the solid working relationships that we helped to build, the unspoiled area of El Carmen was designated the first wilderness area in Latin America,"" Zambrano said about the preserve, considered a global hotspot for biodiversity protection, habitat restoration, and wildlife management programs. ""We greatly appreciate the cooperation and strong partnerships that we have developed with nongovernmental organizations, governments, universities, and private landowners to help protect this unique ecosystem for present and future generations.""</p>
<p>In addition to CEMEX's efforts, Zambrano has also encouraged the development of social programs to benefit the communities in which it operates. Patrimonio Hoy, a highly regarded sales, distribution, and savings program intended to serve Mexico's large self-construction housing market, has benefited close to 200,000 families since its beginnings in 1998, helping them to improve their homes while helping fulfill Mexico's housing needs while creating value for the company.</p>
<p>Zambrano has successfully balanced the interests of different stakeholder groups while promoting CEMEX's environmental stewardship initiatives on a global scale. As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and a leading participant in the Cement Sustainability Initiative, CEMEX has been a pioneer in exploring ways for the cement industry to meet the demands of today without compromising the needs of future generations.</p>
<p>""For CEMEX, sustainability means continually increasing our competitiveness and conducting our operations with the least possible impacts, while reaching out to our stakeholders to foster positive long-term relationships. Our sustainability strategy is to run a highly efficient and profitable business that ensures the safety and well-being of employees, protects the environment, and contributes to the development of our communities. Balancing the needs of all our critical audiences, including our employees and the communities in which we serve, is key to ensuring the ongoing success of our business,"" Zambrano said.</p>
<h2>Active in Advancing Education Initiatives</h2>
<p>Zambrano also has been a long-time champion of education. He is chairman of the board of Mexico's largest private university, TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey, which has 33 campuses in Mexico and international offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. He also served for more than 10 years on the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Zambrano is a member of the IBM Board of Directors, the Citigroup International Advisory Board, and the boards of some leading Mexican companies, including financial services group Grupo Financiero Banamex, soft drink bottler Femsa, and Spanish-language media company Televisa.</p>
<p>He has received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship, the Americas Society's Gold Medal for Distinguished Service, and the 1998 Ernest C. Arbuckle Award for Managerial Excellence from the Stanford GSB Alumni Association.</p>",,,302296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Leadership   ,,,CEMEX,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell

Joss acknowledged the record-breaking gift of the MBA Class of 2006.</p>
<p>Joss presided over the June 17 diploma ceremony that honored the 444 individuals awarded degrees this academic year. The Business School conferred 366 Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees, 1 of them a joint degree with Stanford's School of Law and 17 of them joint degrees with Stanford's School of Education. Seventeen students received doctorates, 7 received a Master of Arts in Business Research degree, and 54 graduates of the Stanford Sloan Master's Program received the Master of Science in Management degree.</p>
<p>As of commencement day, an unprecedented 95 percent of the graduating MBA class raised about $477,000 and exceeded the previous year's record class gift by nearly $70,000. Moreover, students from 42 different countries participated in the class gift.</p>
<p>Of the MBA graduates, 37 achieved distinction as Arjay Miller Scholars. Named in honor of the fourth dean of the Business School, Arjay Miller Scholars are ranked in the top 10 percent of their class by academic performance.</p>
<p>Joss took a moment to acknowledge the achievement of MBA graduate Christian Edvardsen, who last month was one of 10 students from throughout Stanford University honored with the annual <a href=""http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/may24/lyons-052406.html"">James W. Lyons Award</a> for service to the greater Stanford community. Edvardsen, who received his undergraduate degree in accounting from Georgetown University, was honored for his initiative in bringing MBA students and young professionals from around the world together to explore social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, and environmentalism, and for his leadership and team-building skills that contributed to the success of the international Net Impact 2005 Conference.</p>
<p>Held last November, Net Impact ""was the largest conference ever organized at the Stanford Business School,"" said Joss. ""There were 1,600 MBA students from all over the world in attendance. The planning, organizing, and delivery of this took over two years—before this group of students even came to Stanford. So it's a remarkable demonstration of what I would call intergenerational student teamwork.""</p>
<p>Jaime Rodriguez was named the recipient of this year's Ernest C. Arbuckle Award, which was presented by Susan, the youngest daughter of the School's third dean. Rodriguez, who had returned to his native Spain and was not present to accept the award, was nominated and chosen by his peers as having exemplified ""cooperation between students, social involvement, academic excellence, and fun,"" said Arbuckle. Rodriguez, who earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid in Spain, was cited for his service to the School's Academic Committee, Board Fellows Program, Stanford Management Internship Fund, and Global Management Immersion Experience summer internship program. He also created MBA Internationale, a nonprofit association of Spaniards who have earned MBAs abroad.</p>
<p>At the top of the class, Rick Wedell was named the Henry Ford II Scholar and presented with a check for $15,000. A native of Birmingham, Ala., Wedell earned his undergraduate degree in applied mathematics from Harvard University.</p>
<p>Finance faculty selected Robert Quandt to receive the Alexander A. Robichek Student Achievement Award in Finance, for excellence in coursework in the discipline. Quandt, who earned his undergraduate degree in economics and history from Yale University, hails from the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Special recognition was given to graduates who took on extra coursework to complete the certificate program in Global Management, created 12 years ago and dedicated to global issues and international business. Among the 86 recipients, 17 Sloan fellows received certificates.</p>
<p>In introducing the certificate program in Public Management, Professor James Van Horne cited some major initiatives and milestones this academic year: the Net Impact Conference in November; the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Stanford Management Internship Fund program, which ""has reported over the years some 400 SMIF fellows serving about 250 nonprofit organizations,"" according to Van Horne; and the launch of the Service Learning Program to encourage students to work with social entrepreneurs. ""The Class of 2006 was so excited about this program that they pledged nearly $500,000 of their own money to increase the number of trips taken in the future,"" said Van Horne.</p>
<p>Certificates of completion were awarded to 80 MBA and 11 Sloan graduates who passed the course of study in the Public Management Program, created under the leadership of Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller in 1971 to train leaders for the public sector.</p>",,,302296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,,,,,MBA,,,,,Helen Chang
1,3865,3/13/01 0:00,Lessons Worth Knighthood,24,news/headlines/2001arbuckleaward.shtml,"Sir John Browne, the CEO of BP who helped transform the debate over climate change, was honored with the school's highest alumni honor, the Arbuckle Award.",155,"<p>In 1997, the chief executive of a global company chose Stanford to announce his commitment to becoming an active, concerned participant in dealing with the potential problem of global warming. That speech transformed the debate over climate change because the executive was John Browne of British Petroleum, the first major energy company to acknowledge that human activities may be altering Earth's climate.</p>
<p>When Sir John, Sloan '81, returned to campus March 6 to accept the Ernest C. Arbuckle Award, the Business School's highest honor, former dean Michael Spence noted that as BP's leader for six years, Browne had transformed the company into the world's second largest gas and oil company, tripling its stock price and twice reporting the largest quarterly profit ever by any company in any industry. Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998, Sir John introduced technology that allowed better mapping of oil and gas resources and led BP's mega-mergers with Amoco and Arco.</p>
<p>Browne also has been devoted to the School, where he has served on the Advisory Council, talked with the Sloan class every year, and participated the launch of the School's first global management course by allowing BP to be the subject of three of its first case studies.</p>
<p>During his Arbuckle speech, Sir John reflected on lessons he learned at the School and through 10 years of work experience in the United States. It was on this side of the Atlantic, he said, that he learned the importance of trust that is ""not based on your background but on a track record of performance,"" and that ""real performance standards"" for individuals are ""the key to releasing talent."" The School also taught him that management should be ""holistic"" and about the ""positive difference that people make"" because of their diverse talents, characters, and behaviors. Having lived through a series of mergers, he said he has concluded that ""a takeover, if it is just a transfer of assets from one owner to another with the people left behind and laid off, is always going to be suboptimal.""</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Browne also picked up ""the spirit of the frontier"" here. That optimism was useful, he said, when thinking about environmental problems. ""Denial is the wrong response, but so too is despair.</p>
<p>""There is no place better than Stanford to understand the potential of technical progress and the momentum for change which can be created when you link the drive of business with pathbreaking scientific research.""</p>",,,302626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Career & Success,,,,MSx,,,,,Barbara Buell

<p>They're the newest members of the Stanford Graduate School of Business MBA Class of 2010. On September 15 they gathered in Bishop Auditorium to hear kickoff speeches by top Business School officials who detailed the class' different professional backgrounds, challenged them to step out of their comfort zones, and urged them to always aim for something big.</p>
<p>""Remember, the goal here is to learn,"" Sharon Hoffman, associate dean and director of the <a href=""/programs/mba"">MBA Program</a>, told the incoming class. ""As everyone has told you, don't play to your strengths. Take things that are going to stretch you. Volunteer for things you are not good at. The struggle is not something to be avoided at all costs. That is part of the reason you are here."" The current class of 370 students was selected from 6,575 applications, said Derrick Bolton, assistant dean and director of MBA Admissions. ""We had to turn down a lot of really amazing people,"" Bolton said, adding that this year's acceptance rate was about 7.5 percent, making Stanford ""one of the most selective business schools in the world.""</p>
<p>""My goal in saying this is simply to remind you what an incredible privilege it is to be sitting where you are today,"" added Bolton. ""Make the most of the opportunity."" The incoming class reported a total of 119 undergraduate majors, including economics, business management, finance and marketing, international trade, investment, and banking — subjects you'd expect MBAs to embrace. But some of the incoming class had non-business majors including anthropology, cinema, journalism, religious studies, philosophy, sexuality, and studio art.</p>
<p>They worked for organizations including ABC News, Deloitte Consulting, Goldman Sachs, eBay, HSBC Bank, the U. S. Navy, and the Walt Disney Company.</p>
<p>Athleticism is a hallmark for many of the incoming students, who engaged in 30 different sports including archery, fencing, polo, tennis, Ultimate Frisbee, and wrestling. In the class are former members of the Belgian national basketball team, the national fencing team of Jordan, and an Egyptian Tae Kwon Do national champion.</p>
<p>At the professional sports level, a student from Paris had been a professional race car driver, while another incoming student played for both the San Diego Padres and the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Several new students have already been entrepreneurs. One from San Francisco founded a company that sells an anti-gravity treadmill purchased by Nike and the NBA's Golden State Warriors. A student from Madrid launched a website that now has 3 million members and has been dubbed ""the Facebook of Spain,"" after the popular U.S. social networking website. Korea's first music channel was started by yet another new member of the class of 2010. Another student designs dinnerware, flatware, napkins, and invitations for Pottery Barn. A former worker at Southwest Airlines, who designed the rollers used to take bags through airport scanning systems, is a classmate. Lisa Schwallie, senior associate director of the MBA program, urged the incoming MBA students to continue building their accomplishments: ""Strive for something great. We have high expectations for you — both for the two years you will be here and beyond.""</p>

<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/anne-beyer"">Anne Beyer,</a> associate professor of accounting, was presented with the 2013 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award for leading the school's introductory financial accounting class. A graduate of the University of Stuttgart and the Kellogg School of Management, she joined the Stanford faculty straight out of business school, in 2006, and immediately began teaching the intricacies of business transactions, accounting terminology, and rationales for various accounting methods. In their nominations, MBA students praised Beyer for her ""uncanny ability to answer questions and cover complex topics in simple terms the whole class could understand,"" and for fostering a classroom atmosphere ""where questions — or mere expressions of confusion — were welcomed."" As one put it, ""She is not flashy and entertaining, rather she is earnest and direct … I did not have the highest grade in her class, but I did have the highest level of learning.""</p>
<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/ilya-strebulaev"">Ilya Strebulaev</a>, associate professor of finance, was presented with the 2013 Sloan Teaching Excellence Award by graduates of the master's program for mid-career managers and executives. A graduate of the New Economic School, Moscow, and the London Business School, Strebulaev came to Stanford in 2004. In his Sloan Program course, <em>Finance 229</em>, he covered the foundations of corporate finance — including the management of liquidity, capital structure, financial forecasting, dividend policy, financial distress, the cost of capital, and capital budgeting — for students with a wide range of finance experience. As one of his student nominators wrote, ""It's amazing how Ilya was able to understand the diversity of the group. He was committed to making sure we learned about real-life issues."" Said another: ""I fell in love with finance after taking this class."" Strebulaev also won the MBA Distinguished Teaching Award in 2009.</p>
<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/charles-m-lee"">Charles Lee</a>, the Joseph McDonald Professor of Accounting, was given the 2013 PhD Distinguished Faculty Service Award for his work with doctoral students. Born in Taiwan and raised in Canada, Lee earned his PhD at Cornell and taught 14 years at Michigan and Cornell before serving as managing director at Barclays Global Investors (now Blackrock). Since joining the Stanford faculty in 2009, he has developed a strong interest in the investment environment in China and regulatory oversight of Chinese security markets. In their nominations, students praised Lee for his tireless support and hospitality, even after office hours. ""Charles is always excited to discuss research topics with students, and his enthusiasm is infectious,"" wrote one. ""Students leave his office energized and excited to pursue high quality research."" Another put it simply: ""Charles has had a transformative influence — not only on my research, but also on my life.""

1,4395,6/1/06 0:00,Stanford Graduate School of Business Adopts New Curriculum Model ,65,news/headlines/new_mba_curriculum.shtml,Major changes in the content and delivery of management education through its MBA Program will be implemented in fall of 2007.,126,"<p>The faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business has overwhelmingly approved major changes in the content and delivery of management education through its MBA Program. At a May 24 meeting, the faculty voted on a detailed vision for the new curriculum, to be implemented in fall of 2007.</p>
<p>""This new educational model builds on the enormous advantage of our small size to create a high-touch, customized program, with a significant new faculty-student advising and placement component that will challenge every student to his or her fullest capability,"" said Robert L. Joss, the Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>An 11-person task force led by faculty member Garth Saloner recommended the curriculum changes after four months of study and extensive interviews with faculty, students, and alumni around the world. ""These new ideas do not tweak at the margins; they aim to create a new, more global, and more engaging experience for students,"" said Saloner, who is the Jeffrey S. Skoll Professor of Electronic Commerce, Strategic Management, and Economics. ""To be sure, the fundamentals—finance, accounting, operations, marketing and strategy, organizational behavior, and economics—are still there. But the plan capitalizes on the School's strategic choice to remain small, and it makes students think about what is necessary to good management from the first week they arrive here.""</p>
<p>""This is the most important thing that has happened at Stanford in my 27 years here,"" said faculty member Jeffrey Pfeffer, a frequent critic of management education in general. ""The concept is a complete restructuring of the educational process. Today, in a typical large, tiered classroom, students have too passive a role in their learning,"" said Pfeffer, who is the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior at the School. ""This makes students more responsible for their education and potentially engages them more profoundly and more deeply.""</p>
<p>Four key elements characterize the Stanford MBA Program's new educational model:</p>
<ol>
<li>A highly customized program</li>
<li>A deeper, more engaging intellectual experience</li>
<li>A more global curriculum</li>
<li>Expanded leadership and communication development</li>
</ol>
<p>First, the new curriculum will be customized to each student. After a common program in the first quarter, students will face no specific required courses, but rather a set of distribution requirements that will give them the breadth of knowledge a general manager requires. The suite of requirements will vary by pace, depth, and assumed knowledge in order to challenge every student regardless of past experience. Further, in some cases ""flavors"" of a given topic will be offered, so that students can tailor their curriculum to their career goals.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this flexibility, students will need good information and advice about the options available. The first quarter of studies will be devoted in large measure to this. Students will take courses that raise fundamental questions of managerial relevance and that point to where answers may be found. These courses will include Teams and Organizational Behavior, Strategic Leadership, Managerial Finance, and The Global Context of Management.</p>
<p>Students also will form an advising relationship with a member of the faculty. Aided by placement exams, the student and his or her advisor will craft an individual study plan. Students come to the MBA Program with extremely diverse academic and work experience and varying career goals. The new program will channel students into courses that will challenge and prepare them, regardless of their background.</p>
<p>Second, the new curriculum will foster a much deeper intellectual exploration of both broad and narrow subjects. This will begin in a fifth course, tentatively titled Critical Analytical Thinking, taken in the first quarter. In seminars of fewer than 20 people, students will examine issues that transcend any single function or discipline of management, such as: What responsibilities does a corporation have to society? When do markets perform well, and when do they perform poorly? When does it make sense to exercise discretion; when should relatively rigid rules govern behavior? Students will be taught to think and argue about such issues clearly, concisely, and analytically, setting the tone for the rest of the program.</p>
<p>Then, in satisfying distribution requirements and in general electives, students will be pressed to think across disciplines and functions. They will be encouraged to think deeply and on their own. Improved placement will engage students more effectively. A second-year fall schedule will feature intensive one-week seminars, in which students will delve into specific subjects. The School also plans to add to its complement of Bass Seminars, funded in part by a recent $30 million gift from Robert M. Bass, MBA '74. The seminars, as small as 10 people, move students beyond passive learning and into topics of their own choosing. Guided by supervising faculty members, students are largely responsible for creating the content of the seminars.</p>
<p>Third, the new plan calls for enhancements to the School's global management curriculum. This begins with the first-quarter course on The Global Context of Management and proceeds in two ways: The School will continue to globalize its cases and course materials, and a global experience will be required of each student during his or her two years at the School. This can be fulfilled by a study trip, an international internship, an overseas service-learning trip, or a student exchange, such as the School's new program with Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management in China. Finally, the new curriculum includes expanded leadership and communication development. The Strategic Leadership course will integrate strategy with leadership development and implementation. Critical Analytical Thinking will have as a major feature the honing of students' written and oral communication skills. In a new capstone seminar near the end of the two years, students will synthesize what they have learned, examine strengths and weaknesses in their personal leadership style, and reflect on how they hope to achieve their goals as they embark on their careers. These seminars are expected to help students prepare for their jobs and for their careers.</p>
<p>""All this builds on the personal, collaborative nature of the Stanford MBA experience,"" said Joss. ""We have much work ahead of us. Taking this to a new level will require significant funding, a 5 to 10 percent increase in faculty, and ultimately, a new facility with flexible classrooms to accommodate more and smaller seminars.""</p>
<p>The School has developed a building proposal, which will be presented to the Stanford Board of Trustees in June. If accepted, the Business School will pursue a plan for new buildings on the Stanford University campus.</p>",,,302296 | 303071 | 302496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Education,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,3978,5/1/05 0:00,"Professors Kasznik, Peterson, and Skrzypacz, Honored by Students",64,news/headlines/2005teachingawards.shtml,"Students honored professors Andrzej Skrzypacz and Ron Kasznik, and lecturer Joel Peterson with three outstanding faculty awards.",128,"<p>Students have honored three faculty members for outstanding ability as teachers in the annual round of distinguished teaching awards presented at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>Lecturer Joel Peterson was cited for his high commitment to personal values as he received the 2005 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award. Associate Professor of Economics Andrzej (Andy) Skrzypacz received the PhD student Excellence in Service award, and students in the Sloan Program presented Associate Professor of Accounting Ron Kasznik with their Teaching Excellence award for the third time.</p>
<p>Students nominated Peterson in enthusiastic and often lengthy detail cited his ability to engender respect through his work ethic and his commitment to his class, as well as his kindness and compassion. Second-year MBA student Beth Berselli, who introduced the award winner at a noontime ceremony on May 23, said one nominator wrote: ""I've never seen classmates as well prepared as they were in [his] class, a testament to the respect he commands as well as the quality of the class. ""¦ I once scheduled 30 minutes with [him] just to get to know him outside of class and bounce a business idea off of him. He ended up chatting with me for over two hours as if I were the only person on his calendar.""</p>
<p>Another student wrote that Peterson: ""is an inspiration, plain and simple. He brings an uncommon sense of purpose, clarity, accessibility, and presence to the classroom that motivates students unlike any other professor I've been in class with here.""¦ I honestly believe I learned more from Joel Peterson about how to be a truly effective leader than in any other class at the GSB.""</p>
<p>Upon accepting the award, Peterson, who teaches an elective course to second-year MBA students, said he was honored and surprised.</p>
<p>Among those Peterson thanked was the Class of '05, whom he credited with initiating the development of a new organizational behavior course, Leadership Perspectives, offered in the fall of 2004 that he co-taught with faculty colleague Charles O'Reilly. Prior to this new course, Peterson co-taught the elective course Principles of Real Estate Investing with faculty member Steven Grenadier.</p>
<p>Peterson is founder and chairman of Peterson Partners, a private equity firm with interests nationwide. He joined the faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1992 after two decades of real estate investment experience as CFO and managing partner of Trammell Crow Co.</p>
<p>The Distinguished Teaching Award has been presented annually since 1982 by the MBA student Academic Committee. This year the committee received 300 nominations citing outstanding teaching by 65 different faculty members.</p>
<p>During the May 31 lunch hour ceremony organized by doctoral students, Business School Dean Robert L. Joss said: ""The PhD award is really special because in many respects [doctoral students] are expressing themselves in selecting someone you would like to be like""¦as a role model"".</p>
<p>In naming Skrzypacz, nominators cited his excellent service in the areas of research, advising, teaching, and community. Students and alums who have benefited from Andy's role as advisor ""are having a hard time, and it is Andy's fault"" said William Fuchs, a member of the award review committee, ""He has set such a high standard of dedication to his students that it is really hard for us to match.""</p>
<p>Skrzypacz joined the Stanford Business School faculty in 2000, fresh from the doctoral program at University of Rochester. In accepting the honor, he credited his own advisors, while an undergraduate at Warsaw School of Economics as well as at University of Rochester, for shaping his approach to the role.</p>
<p>Students in the one-year Sloan Masters' Program praised Kasznik, their accounting teacher, who previously had been honored by the Sloan classes of 2001 and 2003.</p>
<p>""While it cannot be said that what you taught was everyone's favorite subject, it was your passion for the art of teaching and the enthusiasm you brought to the classroom that made you our favorite professor,"" said Sloan student Ron Ih in his introductory remarks.</p>
<p>Kasznik joined the Stanford Business School faculty in 1995. He earned his graduate and doctoral degrees at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>",,,302301 | 309656 | 302611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,,,,,,,,,,Helen Chang
1,4630,1/1/07 0:00,Gender-Related Material in the New Core Curriculum,50,news/headlines/wim_martin07.shtml,"To attendees at the WIM banquet, 2007 from Prof. Joanne Martin",62,"<p>I spoke informally at the WIM banquet about the paucity of tenure-line faculty who focus primarily on gender research, and about the shortage of gender-related material in the new core curriculum. Members of our GSB Organizational Behavior (OB) faculty (male as well as female) do some gender research: for example, Charles O'Reilly, Dale Miller, and Frank Flynn have published papers on gender topics, and Deb Gruenfeld has explicitly included gender in some of her research on power. In addition, Brian Lowery's research focuses on race and Maggie Neale's has done considerable work on diversity, broadly defined (see below).</p>
<p>Also, there is some gender material that is planned, or at least available from past teaching in core and elective courses, for use in the new core curriculum. Although the Critical Analytical Thinking (CAT ) course will not cover gender issues, OB faculty note that in many of the core and elective courses taught in OB, students raise gender-related questions that become part of the class discussion. Also, please note that planning for the core curriculum is still incomplete.</p>
<p>Maggie Neale: ""In (Managing in Groups and) Teams, we don't speak about gender per se. However, one entire session (the first) is devoted to the issue of team composition and highlights heterogeneous (i.e., diverse) teams and the challenges and benefits of such teams as well as specific prescriptions directed towards team leaders about how to be effective in such teams. In the second session of Teams, we focus on group process and end the session with a set of prescriptions for how to get your voice heard when you are a(n) (opinion) minority. In addition, we bring in the latest literature on ways in which we can be successful in getting a different opinion or perspective 'heard' and highlight what we know (in terms of research results) about how to be successful both as leaders and as members of such team.""</p>
<p>Frank Flynn: ""Last fall I taught three sections of the OB core. We first introduced the topic of gender stereotypes in our second class session, particularly how these stereotypes can impact subjective performance appraisals and promotions. To provide fodder for our discussion, I presented students with the results from Rouse and Goldin's symphony study published in AER (American Economic Review) (in which women (musicians) who auditioned ""behind the curtain"" were 50 percent more likely to get picked). I taught three cases in the core, only one of which focuses on a single protagonist. That case involved a female entrepreneur/venture capitalist named Heidi Roizen. In addition to discussing this case in class, I invited Heidi to visit the class (she spoke to all six sections). During her visit, Heidi commented extensively on the difficulties of being a woman in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>""To support this discussion, I presented to students the results from a study I did a couple years ago involving the Heidi Roizen case. Specifically, with Harvard's permission, I changed the original materials so that one section of the class received a version of the case called ""Howard"" Roizen (same case, just different pronouns) and the other section received the original case. Before class, I had the students go online and rate their impressions of ""Roizen"" on several dimensions. As you might expect, the results show that students were much harsher on Heidi than on Howard across the board. Although they think she's just as competent and effective as Howard, they don't like her, they wouldn't hire her, and they wouldn't want to work with her. As gender researchers would predict, this seems to be driven by how much they disliked Heidi's aggressive personality. The more assertive they thought Heidi was, the more harshly they judged her (but the same was not true for those who rated Howard).</p>
<p>""In the final session for the OB course, we focus on the issue of diversity. As part of this session, I have students discuss the diversity at the GSB, a conversation that hinges on gender issues along with race and nationality. Taken together with the other sessions I mentioned, this seems to me like quite a bit of content that's dedicated to gender issues (out of only nine class sessions). (Planning for the new core course, and Heidi Roizen's availability, are not yet settled).""</p>
<p>Deb Gruenfeld (with regard to core OB courses taught prior to the new curriculum): ""There will be gender content in the core this year (2007, as I assume there was last year) because Frank (Flynn's) research on gender is now part of at least one session on networks, and it might very well be in other places as well. In addition, the last time I taught the core Brian (Lowery) and I addressed gender explicitly in our diversity session. My elective will deal with gender related issues, although this is not an explicit focus, as the challenges associated with ""Acting with Power"" tend to fall out on gender lines (e.g., in terms of the typical struggles I see, often they relate to women being uncomfortable with their authority, being too participative, not comfortable giving direction, and men being too authoritative, not comfortable being participative or subordinating oneself, even when hierarchy calls for that behavior).""</p>
<p>Charles O'Reilly: ""One of the nine cases we do (in the Leadership part of the required course on Strategic Leadership is on Meg Whitman—which explicitly includes a discussion of gender, women's leadership styles and are they different, and career issues for women. Throughout the term there was continuing reference to issues of gender and career issues. It (gender) used to be in H280 (the human resource core course) that we did a session on diversity (women) and career issues. In OB363 (the elective co-taught with Joel Peterson) we had three women leaders last year (Ann Fudge, Liz Davila and Lynn Twist) and much of the discussion during the term was around work-family balance (including with male leaders).""</p>",,,302401 | 302461 | 302181 | 302206 | 302466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,Organizational Behavior,Career & Success,,,,,,,,,Helen Chang
1,4441,11/1/10 0:00,John Roberts Altered the Study of Industrial Organization,57,news/headlines/roberts_conference.html,John Roberts' groundbreaking work in industrial organization affected the course of economic research and inspired a new generation of economists.,146,"<p>Dressed in a tank top and funny hat on a warm spring day in 1989, Scott Schaefer was about to leave his undergraduate economics class by the back door when he noticed Professor Paul Milgrom, PhD '79, and a broad-shouldered guest professor with wavy hair and glasses staring at him from the front of the room. Schaefer took the look as a cue to approach and when he did, Milgrom asked, ""Are you ready to go?""</p>
<p>Apparently, Schaefer's roommate had forgotten to pass along a message that Milgrom and John Roberts, an economist on the faculty of Stanford GSB, wanted to take him to lunch at the Stanford Faculty Club after class that day. Unlike Roberts, who was clad in a dark blue blazer, Schaefer had not dressed for the occasion.</p>
<p>At lunch, they discussed a paper Schaefer had written for class. ""You should be an economist,"" they told him. Bubbling over from their attention, Schaefer acquiesced. He earned a doctorate at the business school in 1995 and today is a professor of economics at the University of Utah.</p>
<p>At a September conference at Stanford GSB, Schaefer was among several of Roberts' former students and coauthors to present reflections of how his work and mentorship affected both the course of economic research and their lives. The conference, organized by Roberts' former students Susan Athey, PhD '95, now a professor at Harvard, and Robert Gibbons, PhD '85, now a professor at MIT, was an opportunity for veterans to step back and assess four decades of research while giving doctoral students a chance to witness these scholars present the history of their chosen field and Roberts' central role in it. Others who spoke at the conference were MIT Professor Bengt Holmstrom, PhD '78; University of Pennsylvania Professor Andrew Postlewaite; Jonathan Day, managing partner at Heidrick and Struggles; and Stanford economics Professors Kyle Bagwell, PhD '86 and Nick Bloom.</p>
<p>Roberts, the John H. Scully Professor of Economics, Strategic Management, and International Business, has been teaching at Stanford since 1980. He has published more than 70 articles in academic journals, 2 books, and 30 business cases. His work has ranged from using game theory to study public goods problems to running field experiments on the impact of improving management practices. Along the way, he has gained a throng of admirers among his students and colleagues.</p>
<p>Roberts' journey to academia began when he was still in high school in Winnipeg. Back then, his peers referred to him as ""The Professor,"" but ""it was not meant as a compliment. I suppose I was a bit of a know-it-all,"" he recalls. Then in 1962, in an introductory college economics course, he realized that he wanted to be an economist. ""It seemed to answer so many questions, especially regarding the role of Keynesian fiscal policy in fighting unemployment,"" Roberts remembers. ""Ironically, I have never done any research on such issues.""</p>
<p>His best known research is in industrial organization, where he and Milgrom introduced the study of the strategic impacts of information differences between interacting parties on industrial behavior. Although their logic is often very subtle, their insights and methods revolutionized the way industrial competition is modeled and led to adoption of these methods in other fields</p>
<p>Their first effort in this direction was a paper titled ""Limit Pricing and Entry Under Incomplete Information: An Equilibrium Analysis,"" which appeared in Econometrica in 1982. At the time, many economists thought limit pricing - the act of a firm purposefully setting low prices to deter new competitors - was irrational. Roberts and Milgrom showed that it would be rational if potential entrants to the same market took the price as an indicator of how low the incumbent's costs were and thus how tough a competitor it would be. Strikingly, however, they also said the potential entrant would, if it understood the economics of the situation, infer the incumbent's actual costs from observing its price and thus would enter the market in exactly the same circumstances as it would were it informed directly about the incumbent's costs. Still, the incumbent must reduce its prices from the monopoly level or it will be thought to be limit pricing but have high costs that would encourage entry.</p>
<p>""It was one of the most exciting times in economics that I ever observed and could ever imagine,"" Roberts says. ""Traditional wisdom was being turned on its head every day."" He remembers presenting their paper to some of the ""major stars of economics,"" and his assertion that ""equilibrium limit pricing does not deter entry"" was met with disbelief.</p>
<p>At least one of their senior colleagues found the entire idea of building theories based on private information - meaning information not directly observable by others - to be destructive to economics as an empirical science, Milgrom recalls. ""Thank God for John who said, 'No, we're on to something. Let's stick with it.' And we did.""</p>
<p>Today the role of information differences in explaining behavior is accepted among economic theorists, and hundreds of researchers have built upon the initial research, exploring predation and other strategic behavior in industrial organization.</p>
<p>But economics is not the only thing that takes up Roberts' time. The students and colleagues who've spent hours at his table know the native of Canada is also somewhat of a gourmet. He is an excellent cook, and during the winter holidays, he annually spends two days in the kitchen preparing traditional cassoulet, a complex French pork and bean recipe.</p>
<p>Of all his work, Roberts indicates that he is proudest of the textbook he coauthored with Milgrom, titled Economics, Organization, and Management, which was the first to apply economics to the organization and management of companies. The book has garnered many thousands of citations in scholarly articles, an unparalleled accomplishment in economics. Reading it first as a graduate student, Athey said she was struck by the fact that ""every single paragraph can be perfectly formalized in a model. How you can fill an entire book with perfectly crafted paragraphs is an amazing feat.""</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> called Roberts' other book, <em>The Modern Firm</em>, the best business book of 2004. In it, Roberts analyzes the interaction between the optimal organizational design of business firms, their strategies, and the business environments in which they operate. He argues that changes in organizational design can be predictable and that they can improve performance and growth as long as these factors are examined in a holistic way.</p>
<p>Recently, Roberts, with Stanford economics Professor Nick Bloom and other young scholars, has been studying experimentally the effects of improving management practices. When Bloom first considered an academic career, a mentor connected him with Roberts in London. Bloom expected to meet the venerable figure in one of the many restaurants or cafes suitable for an academic discussion. Instead, Roberts led them to a pub near Bloom's office called the Drunken Captain, where Bloom noticed a strange, pungent odor wafting from Roberts' direction. He tried to ignore it. After a beer, Roberts ""said he had just been out shopping for strong cheeses,"" Bloom recalled. ""Since that time he has been a very easy person to work with.""</p>

<p>The author of four books and more than sixty published papers, Singleton will assume his position in July 2012. ""I'm excited about taking this on, though as it all sinks in it also looks increasingly daunting,"" he says.</p>
<p>""The <em>Journal of Finance</em> is generally considered the most prestigious in the field.

In his 28 years at Merrill Lynch he rose to president, then headed TIAA-CREF, later served as National Finance Chair for Senator John McCain's campaign for President in 2000, and most recently headed the nation's Troubled Asset Recovery Program (TARP) in 2009.</p>
<p>Thanks, Garth, for your kind introduction.</p>
<p>I'm honored to have the privilege of addressing you, this year's graduates of the world's finest business school.</p>
<p>Congratulations on completing the journey that brought you to this ceremony.</p>
<p>When I was asked to speak at today's ceremony, I wondered what I could say that would resonate with you — 450 unique individuals with differing backgrounds, values, interests, and aspirations.</p>
<p>So, I met with some of your classmates in April to ask what was on their minds and perhaps yours.</p>
<p>One told me he was excited, but also apprehensive.</p>
<p>Another said she feared losing her way toward having the kind of impact on the world she wants to have.</p>
<p>Another asked about leadership styles — and whether it's best to ""be yourself"" or to adopt a certain style that may have more impact.</p>
<p>And, finally, one person asked what mattered to me when I graduated.</p>
<p>Well, it's been quite a while since I was sitting in your seats — in fact, I'll soon attend my 40th reunion. But I still vividly remember having the same kinds of ambivalent feelings, doubts, and hopes when I graduated.</p>
<p>Today, I want to share with you a few short stories about my winding path over these past four decades, stories that are meant to underscore some advice that I hope will help you along your own journey ahead.</p>
<p>Let's get to the advice right away. It's pretty simple.</p>
<p>There is one thing that you should take with you when you leave this campus and, from now on, never be without - and that's your own personal compass.</p>
<p>By that I mean a set of commitments to yourself that are grounded on your innermost thoughts about what's important to you, what you want out of life, and how you'll have to conduct yourself to uphold your self-respect.</p>
<p>I can assure you that if you live by your own compass - continuously using it to guide the choices you make in the days and years ahead - you'll be fine.</p>
<p>You won't fall into the trap of following the path that's obvious, conventional, and overcrowded; or the path of least resistance; or the path that others expect you to take; or the path that you think looks most impressive to all your friends.</p>
<p>Instead, you will chart your own course, based on your deepest values and preferences.</p>
<p>When I was in your place, I had already created a personal compass: two commitments to myself.</p>
<p>One was to take the most challenging opportunities open to me, those that would test me the most, and accelerate my growth.</p>
<p>I had just spent four years in the Navy and two in the GSB, and I felt that many of my peers had moved ahead of me in building their lives and careers. I was in a hurry to catch up.</p>
<p>During my interviews for a job after graduation, Morgan Stanley told me I'd have to carry some investment banker's briefcase for five years before running my own deals.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said they were short of talent and I'd be running deals within a year. So I chose Merrill, even though it then lacked Morgan's cachet and market share.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a fabulous, 28-year odyssey. But it almost ended before it got started.</p>
<p>That's because my second commitment to myself was to speak honestly and openly, even if it put me at odds with those around me.</p>
<p>When I became disenchanted with Merrill's banking division in my first months there - because it was bureaucratic and I wasn't permitted to use the advanced financial models I'd learned at Stanford - I brashly attempted what's now called ""transformational leadership,"" but from my perch at the very bottom of the organizational pyramid.</p>
<p>I wrote a memo to the head of investment banking, blasting the division's structure and management and proposing sweeping changes.</p>
<p>Needless to say, he didn't appreciate my insights. Soon after, I was transferred out of the country.</p>
<p>They sent me to Merrill's tiny outpost in Paris. Before leaving, I asked an old timer, ""What's it like to work for Merrill overseas?"" He said, ""We don't know. No one's ever come back alive.""</p>
<p>Although my bosses and peers thought I was ticketed for oblivion, I chose to see the opportunity in my situation - a chance to be a pioneer in Merrill's expansion across Europe.</p>
<p>I thrived in Paris and, after 18 months, another offbeat opportunity appeared when the Shah of Iran asked Merrill to send an expert on capital markets to help develop the Tehran Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Now, if Paris was considered a backwater, you can only imagine how Tehran was viewed. But I begged for the assignment because it fascinated me. I knew it would be challenging, and I'd gain some visibility as Merrill's only representative in the Middle East. When no veteran banker would take it, Merrill and the Iranians reluctantly settled for a 30-year-old with just 2Â½ years experience.</p>
<p>I spent four years in Iran building a start-up joint venture that became Merrill's first investment in a domestic, diversified securities business outside the U.S.</p>
<p>My Merrill friends had completely written me off by then, but following one's compass along unbeaten paths often leads to unexpected benefits.</p>
<p>By far the most important one for me, and the most unexpected, was meeting my future wife on my first day of work in Tehran.</p>
<p>Soon, I also discovered that Merrill's chairman at the time, Don Regan, had adopted the Iran venture as his pet project. He and other top executives began visiting Tehran regularly, and I got to know them well.</p>
<p>A few years later, I was reassigned to Merrill's headquarters as assistant to the chairman and president, working on the company's strategic plan.  So, my career was still alive. But then it became even more important to chart my own course and follow my personal compass.</p>
<p>I wanted to gain broad-based experience across the company — the kind that would prepare me, perhaps, to lead Merrill one day. So I took jobs in areas ranging from marketing to human resources to finance, because I wanted the challenges and the skills they offered. </p>
<p>Looking back, I see that my migration across the company not only broadened my experience but also compelled me to learn the essence of what's now called ""transformational leadership"" — the kind of leadership that brings about real change in an organization.</p>
<p>What I learned is that transformational leadership is not about the skills and authority you as leader bring to the table. It's about tapping the innate aspirations of the people you lead - the same aspirations we all have - to make a difference, to grow, to have a voice, and to be recognized.</p>
<p>And transformational leadership is also about becoming one with those people.</p>
<p>I began almost all of my jobs as a total stranger to the people I would lead. Typically, they knew their business much better than I did and were rightly skeptical of my qualifications to chart a new direction for their organization.</p>
<p>I learned that if I tried to overcome their doubts by using rational arguments or imposing my authority, they might acquiesce for the moment, but eventually they'd undermine change, actively or passively, when the going got tough.</p>
<p>So, I took a different approach. I asked the employees to take the lead. I put them in charge of finding the truth about our situation, grappling with the facts among themselves and proposing the goals, strategies, and cultural norms we'd need to succeed.</p>
<p>It was certainly a gamble. But I was confident that if they found the facts and debated the issues together, they would come up with a plan at least as good as any that I would devise. And because they created it themselves, they'd own it and execute it enthusiastically.</p>
<p>That approach has worked well throughout my entire career. In every situation, I've found that, once people recognized I was relying on their proposals, they produced plans far more ambitious than I would have dared to impose — and their commitment to plans of their making achieved far more than I originally thought possible. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean that the transformational leader is a bystander as others run the organization - far from it. You must be highly visible, decisive, and unbending in cultivating the ultimate determinant of your organization's success: the environment in which people operate every day.</p>
<p>You have to insist on the highest standards of ethical conduct, and never give a second chance to those who bend the truth or abuse others. You have to liberate people at all levels to tell the truth openly about the organization's situation. You have to assure that those you choose to supervise others have the character to lead. You have to ask the tough questions that cause people to think more deeply about their decisions. And you have to urge people to work with you to define a mission for the company that gives everyone a fulfilling sense of purpose. </p>
<p>Let me give you a personal example of this form of leadership.</p>
<p>I returned to investment banking in the early '90s as division director after leaving it 20 years earlier as a junior associate. The senior bankers were dubious, to say the least, about my qualifications to lead them.</p>
<p>Back then, Merrill ranked in the second tier of investment banks. The division was fragmented into product and regional fiefdoms that often competed with each other for business. </p>
<p>So I asked the bankers to examine our market position, structure, culture, and incentives.</p>
<p>After debating among themselves, they agreed that we should reorganize into groups focused on clients with similar needs. Instead of paying bankers for generating revenue, we would pay them for developing close advisory relationships with clients and for getting high marks individually for integrity, teamwork, and reliability.</p>
<p>Our new model departed radically from the norms on Wall Street, and it proved astonishingly effective. In just four years, Merrill became the first firm to lead the debt, equity, and M&A league tables simultaneously in the U.S. and worldwide. And by paying for relationships instead of revenues, we earned profits that shattered previous records.</p>
<p>My personal journey has been exciting, rewarding, and less risky than it often appeared, because so many people worked beside me, carried me along, and delivered the results associated with me.</p>
<p>I wish I could take some credit for this approach to transformational leadership, but Lao Tzu defined it 2,500 years ago. In his words, which I've updated slightly, ""A leader is best when people barely know she exists. When her work is done, her aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.""</p>
<p>Essentially, transformational leadership is creating an environment for collaborative learning - by everyone in the organization.</p>
<p>You already have first-hand knowledge of how effective that environment can be, because you've been immersed in it here, at the GSB. Your professors — and mine for that matter — didn't provide the answers. Instead, they invited us to grapple with information, identify key issues, and reach our own conclusions. And because we actively participated in our own learning, we took ownership of it — and we won't forget it.</p>
<p>I hope you will take that same approach to the organizations you are entering.</p>
<p>Today, you stand at an important and joyous threshold in your lives.</p>
<p>It's normal to be both excited and a bit apprehensive about whether you'll live up to your expectations for yourself. Please embrace that insecurity; don't try to suppress it. It's rocket fuel for your life. It's powered you to this point, so let it power you forward.</p>
<p>The question for you now isn't whether you have the abilities and drive to succeed. You already proved that by joining the select few who have earned GSB degrees.</p>
<p>What matters most is not what particular goals you have for your career, like building the next great tech company or leading a not-for-profit that's improving lives in your home country, because those outcomes aren't totally within your control.</p>
<p>What does matter most is how you choose to live your life, what code of conduct will be your personal compass.</p>
<p>As John Gardner, the great humanitarian and former GSB professor, once wrote: ""Nature is fascinated by talent, but it pays off on character.""</p>
<p>Countless times in your career you'll face difficult decisions. Almost always, the toughest decisions will be those that test your values. You'll often have little or no time to deliberate, and what you decide may well determine your future, your reputation, and your self-respect.</p>
<p>If you don't have a clear idea of who you are and the kind of person you want to be - if you don't have a sturdy compass that you follow without deviating - you'll be rudderless in a swirling ocean. You'll lose your right to lead, and you won't have the impact you desire.</p>
<p>What I fervently hope for each of you is that your actions across your life will comport with your values, so that when you return to Stanford for your 40th reunion, in 2051, you'll be able to look back with satisfaction, knowing that you were true to yourself.</p>
<p>Thank you, and good luck!</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,Career & Success | Leadership | Management,,,Merrill Lynch,MBA,,,,,Helen Chang
1,4005,1/1/06 0:00,Top Government Officials Greet Study Trip Participants,54,news/headlines/2006studytrips.shtml,"Stanford GSB MBA study trips visit India, Israel, and the Philippines.",70,"<p>Meetings with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Israeli elder statesman and Nobel laureate Shimon Peres and former Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, and former Philippine President Corazon Aquino highlighted winter holiday 2005 study trips organized by Stanford MBA students.</p>
<p>Each year, student trips offer a brief but intensive learning experience in parts of the world of interest to Business School students. Alumni or classmates who have previously worked or studied in the countries involved may help students arrange meetings with leaders of major corporations and nonprofit agencies, as well as governmental leaders. Here are some observations from trip participants.</p>
<p>During our time with him, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh discussed three topics: entrepreneurship, development, and education. India has always been an entrepreneurial country, he said, even during British colonialism. After Indian independence, the nation's government had a major role in developing industry. Though this relationship between the state and enterprise created inefficiencies, India still managed GDP growth of 4 to 5 percent annually through the late 1970s. As the state's role in enterprise declined through a series of economic reforms in the 1980s and, more significantly, in the 1990s, private enterprise blossomed, causing the growth rate to accelerate to today's 6 to 7 percent rate. ""Additional economic reforms are necessary to further liberate private enterprise to create more jobs and innovate,"" he concluded.</p>
<p>Discussing India's transition from a developing nation into a developed one, PM Singh said that by accelerating India's economic growth by 2 to 3 percent annually, the nation's GDP growth could hit 10 percent and enter the ranks of the developed economies. The improvement of infrastructure is critical to this effort, he said, particularly since rural communities are largely cut off from the rest of India. He said that infrastructure improvements, particularly roads, would enable rural areas to begin catching up with growth in urban centers. He also argued that foreign direct investment would increase significantly as India's transportation and power infrastructure improved.</p>
<p>PM Singh concluded our meeting by sharing his views on education. Social needs in India require improving education and the participation rate of children in education. He argued that the latter is as pressing an issue as the former, as short-term economic needs drive children to work. India's goal is to provide universal education for children to the age of 14, but in many areas, particularly rural areas, India's performance is poor. He also called for greater inclusion of young girls in the educational system. Girls have a much lower literacy rate than boys, which indicates that they are being ignored in the current system. PM Singh argued that shrinking this gap will help India slow down its population growth rate as young women will be able to make better choices. He added that India's higher education system is world-class and a significant driver to economic growth.</p>
<p>A year ago, a most uncanny group — five Israelis and two Americans; six Jews and one Christian; two women and five men; seven wildly different individuals — came together under one dream: to take our classmates to Israel. For some of the leadership and the trip participants, there was a deep-seated desire to share their homeland with the Stanford Graduate School of Business community. For others, it was a new adventure to discover the politics, religion, and history of this mystical place in greater detail. For all of us, it was a time for 40 students, significant others, and professors to truly explore, learn, and bond.</p>
<p>Our 10-day excursion throughout Israel gave me a wealth of information (that I am still processing) and a whole host of funny stories, serious topics, and interesting business ideas I want to discuss with my classmates. So what do I tell you when I have such a short amount of your time to pique your interest in a country that is full of intriguing contradictions: modern structures standing by ruins, peacefulness and fun alongside unrest, a religious state with an ever-increasing youth population with secular mindsets? I think the most important thing to tell you is that I believe.</p>
<p>I believe in Israel's entrepreneurialism. We kicked off our trip with Ofra Strauss of Strauss-Elite, and no doubt by the end of the presentation, I believed in her organization's ability to compete head-to-head with the largest food companies in the world. Gil Shwed of Check Point Software Technologies, Roni Naftali of Eden Springs, and franchiser Omri Padan further fanned this flame for me. The fighting, scrappy nature of this country has produced a unique business culture of true rainmakers who believe in their ability to grow a business and expand the economy from the ground up.</p>
<p>I believe in embracing the unknown: Historically, there is so much to see and learn from Israel's past. We took a number of tours during which we saw ruins dating back thousands of years that evoked discussions and intense emotions. For some of us, experiencing the Holy Land at Christmas was an emotional high that we struggle to find the words to explain. Walking through Yad Vashem reminded us of both the evilness that can exist and the resiliency of the human spirit. Yet amongst all of this history, there is an air of ""what is to come?"" that needs to be embraced positively. Will there ever be peace?</p>
<p>I believe there can and will be peace. Honestly, I was skeptical during our study trip. We had the great fortune of meeting Shimon Peres and Benyamin Netanyahu in addition to military intelligence officers, government officials, and religious leaders. At times I sat listening in despair as great minds such as these disagreed so vehemently about solutions to peace. However, as I reflect post-trip, I am struck by two encouraging thoughts: 1) Despite disagreements, they keep talking, and 2) the young want peace. We were visited at Stanford by a great group of four Israeli college students whose ideas and grassroots efforts remind me civil rights-era activists who sat at forbidden lunch counters in the American South or who decided that the end of educational segregation had to begin with nine bold students walking through an Arkansas school door. The common man's fight can exceed government's reluctance, and I believe Israel has this on its side.</p>
<h2>What were some of the best meetings on the study trip?</h2>
<p>FP: The most inspirational meeting for me was the one with Corazon Aquino. For those who don't know who she is, she was Time magazine's Person of the Year in 1986. After her husband, a popular senator-in-exile, was assassinated in 1983, this former housewife rose to power in 1986, becoming the Philippines' first female president, overturning a strongly entrenched dictatorship led by Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>People poured into the streets as part of a generally peaceful ""People Power"" movement to signal that they were done with silently accepting a corrupt regime increasingly careless with abuses of power. Amazing! And even at the age of 73, she's still active in caring about the socioeconomic development of the country, being heavily involved in microfinance initiatives.</p>
<p>BM: I, too, agree with Felix that our most interesting meeting was with Corazon Aquino. She is a national figure — actually a world figure — who defied a dictator and reformed a nation. The catch was that she was a housewife who no one ever suspected would become president. Despite all her accomplishments, she remained soft-spoken, warm, intelligent, and inspirational. I felt that even if you did not know her background, you knew she was someone tremendously special.</p>
<p>The other meeting that I felt was impressive was visiting a weaving outfit in Kalibo (a small town away from the capital) before going to hit the beaches in Boracay. It was a micro-operation, but it was typical of the contracts that a lot of high-profile brands have in third-world countries. This operation made handmade reed-woven purses, pillowcases, and handbags, etc. for Calvin Klein. Ask any of the fashion experts on our trip, and they will proudly tell you that they now know what the latest fad to hit the Stanford Shopping Center this spring will be. I am not a fashion expert, but I will tell you that I bought a few things and my wife loved them!</p>
<h2>What was the most memorable moment for you on the study trip?</h2>
<p>FP: I think there were quite a few, but scuba-diving for the first time in my life at the beach resort we were at ranks right up there. I did the introductory course. It was simply amazing to be able to breathe underwater and to see the aquatic life that existed 10 meters below sea level. I felt like a fish!</p>
<p>But the hissing sound that came from my air tank was worrying""¦ despite my instructor's assurances. Somehow, ""Yes, air is leaking but you will have enough,"" just wasn't the most reassuring thing to hear. And my mother clearly didn't share my newfound enthusiasm for scuba-diving. When I told her about the experience, she said, ""You mean like a giant aquarium?"" That definitely put a new perspective to it!</p>
<p>Some of us also very briefly got to be TV stars. [It was] arranged for us to be interviewed live on a breakfast show. That was another incredible experience for us, to see what goes behind the scenes in a live production and to actually be a part of the whole show.</p>
<p>BM: I would have to say it was meeting [someone] who exclaimed when she saw me, ""I saw you on TV this morning""¦ actually at least a million people saw you this morning."" You know, after that the paparazzi just never let up the rest of the trip. I am kidding about the paparazzi, but not the comment. I wonder if my 15 seconds of fame have been used up; my wife says I probably have five left so I shouldn't worry too much about it.</p>
<p>Final parting impressions of the Philippines?</p>
<p>FP: It's still a very family business — oriented environment. We met with the major conglomerates, all of which are family-run, and I think the winners will be those who manage the transition to professional management the best. There is a huge entrepreneurial opportunity for anyone able to understand what works well in a developed country and has the ability to do a ""copy-and-paste"" execution of that in the Philippines.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Education | Management,Asia-Pacific,,,MBA,,,,,Helen Chang
1,3884,2/19/03 0:00,Richard Kovacevich Honored with 2003 Arbuckle Award,51,news/headlines/2003arbuckleaward.shtml,"Teams can outperform the abilities of any individual member, says Wells Fargo CEO.",82,"<p>Years before he became one of the nation's most respected banking leaders, Richard Kovacevich prepared for a leadership role by playing baseball, peddling rosebushes for a grocery store, and running a toy company. Today the head of Wells Fargo is a strong believer that broad experience makes great business leaders and that teams can perform well above the abilities of any individual member.</p>
<p>""A good leader inspires a team to have confidence in the leader. A great leader inspires a team to have confidence in themselves,"" he told a dinner audience. As president and CEO of Wells Fargo, Kovacevich sees his job as to ""hire, retain, reward, and recognize the best people; coach them to become effective leaders; and be sure they care.""</p>
<p>""In selecting people, I don't care how much a person knows until I know how much they care. Give people responsibility and accountability, ""¦ encourage them to be active in their communities, to be leaders. Create, describe, and communicate the corporate culture, vision, and values; make sure everyone is having fun, and then get out of the way and cheer them on.""</p>
<p>Kovacevich was honored by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association Feb. 19 as the 2003 Arbuckle Award recipient. Named for the late dean Ernest Arbuckle, the award recognizes an outstanding member of the Business School community who demonstrates a dual commitment to managerial excellence and to addressing the changing needs of society.</p>
<p>Kovacevich urged leaders to endorse the affirmation that virtually everyone in an organization wants to contribute and do a good job and therefore needs to be treated with respect. ""Almost every person at Wells Fargo knows more about their specific work than I do,"" Kovacevich said. ""There's no need to waste time coming to me for decisions. Our people make decisions and then let me know what they decided.""</p>
<p>Effective institutions need both managers and leaders, people with different strengths, he said. ""Managers rely on systems, leaders rely on people. Managers work on getting things right, leaders work on the right things. The answer to every problem, choice, or opportunity in our company is known to someone or some team in the company. The leader only has to find that person, listen, and help them effect the change.""</p>
<p>""You cannot share vision unless you share the power to achieve that vision,"" he told the audience.</p>
<p>Kovacevich, who is the 33<sup>rd</sup> recipient of the Arbuckle Award, holds bachelor's and master's degrees in industrial engineering from Stanford as well as his MBA, which he received in 1967.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,,,,Leadership | Management,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,77041,10/2/12 0:00,A New Program Helps Entrepreneurs Make Their Mark,49,news/headlines/making-their-mark.html,A collaboration with Endeavor Global helps high-impact entrepreneurs build their skills.,88,"<p>When the nonprofit organization Endeavor Global says they mentor ""high-impact"" entrepreneurs around the world, they're not kidding.</p>
<p>Take Yossi Hasson, the charismatic founder of one of South Africa's leaders in hosted email and internet security services. Bitten by the entrepreneurial bug since he was a child, after a string of clever startups he cofounded SYNAQ in 2004, which delivers enterprise-level applications based on open source software at a significant savings in comparison to Microsoft competitors. The company has earned the #6 spot on the South Africa FastGrowth 100 Index.</p>
<p>Like the other 61 Endeavor-sponsored entrepreneurs attending the first educational program offered by the <a href=""http://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies</a> (SEED) in August, Hasson is a successful business owner. But there's always room for improvement. ""I wanted more of a foundation in how to scale a global business, and tools to minimize mistakes,"" said the Israeli-born South African, explaining what brought him many miles from his home to the California coastline.</p>
<p>The weeklong program, held at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, drew on the school's world-class business faculty and networks to help Endeavor entrepreneurs like Hasson build growth companies in a competitive global marketplace. Silicon Valley alumni with expertise in operations also returned to Stanford to coach working groups during the program.</p>
<p>Flipping through a binder chock full of scribbled notes, Hasson neatly itemizes the top three themes that made the biggest impression on him at the Stanford program: how to make decisions and lead more effectively, how to benchmark as a means of creating more effective marketing, and how to understand the context of local markets in order to branch out globally more effectively. ""I have at least nine new approaches to marketing that we'll be trying,"" he says enthusiastically.</p>
<p>At the far north of the African continent, Egyptian entrepreneur Amr Shady has also been an early starter, cofounding the company for which he now serves as CEO, T.A. Telecom, at age 23. The enterprise is one of the most profitable, fastest-growing companies in the Middle East and Africa. Managing operations in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Kenya, Shady is a firmly established leader with more than 12 years of executive experience in the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>""After having spent a week at Stanford, I have a whole new appreciation for the kind of sales strategy we will need,"" says Shady. ""I've already sent the case studies and materials to my people in operations and sales so that we can start developing a new plan.""</p>
<p>Gigliola Aycardi Batista, one of the few women attending the program, co-wrote the business plan for an innovative health club enterprise back in 1997. It was an ingenious no-brainer: integrate medicine, health, and fitness for clients on-site. Today, her company, BodyTech, is lifting up the health club standard across Latin America. The organization's 30 gyms in Colombia employ 1,300 people, and the company is expanding throughout Latin America.</p>
<p>Batista says she was attracted to the program because she knew it would expose her to strategic business issues ""in a very concentrated and efficient way. One of the critical things I've learned is that the way we're approaching our entry into different countries needs to be modified. We're having more than just 'human resources' issues — we may need to fundamentally change how we operate to be more respectful of cultural differences.""</p>
<p>Mauricio Hoyos of Colombia is cofounder and CEO of a financial services company, Conexred, which allows 8 million customers, mostly Colombians, to electronically pay bills for such things as electricity and telephone services, through 47,000 outlets, mostly mom-and-pop stores.</p>
<p>""Our challenge is going from one type of product to a portfolio without losing control of the money,"" he says. For example, the company now has a contract with the government to deliver monthly stipends to the elderly.</p>
<p>But, like other entrepreneurs in the Stanford program, Hoyos says, he understands the financial aspects of growing his business better than the organizational behavior side. ""Most of the teachers here are psychological teachers, and we need help with that. They say, 'Look, you go through a phase of excitement and then you go through a phase when you are stressed, and humans behave better if you do this, and don't do that.'""</p>
<p>Also based in Latin America, Jaime Cater, another serial entrepreneur, has opened more than 30 different companies throughout his lifetime thus far. He was eager for the Stanford teachings to help him with his goal to make his current venture, Health Digital Systems, to be the one that leaves its mark on the Mexican people. The company provides hospitals, clinics and state insurance providers with open-source software to digitize and share records, providing a much-needed technological upgrade for the country's citizens. Since 2009, revenues have jumped more than 1,200%.</p>
<p>""It's a great opportunity to step back and take a look at my business from different perspectives,"" Cater says about the Stanford program. ""I'm bringing home 30 pages of notes and a completely different vision of how to deal with staff and the core talent in my organization. I'm realizing now that it can't just be about 'my way.'""</p>

1,4149,4/1/08 0:00,Stanford Black Business Students Association Celebrates 25 Years,64,news/headlines/bbsa_08.html,"About 200 people including some 40 alums attended Gathering 25, a two-day conference to celebrate the club's 25th anniversary.",126,"<p>When Richard Phillips came to Stanford GSB in fall 2007, he knew he'd find professional and personal support at the Black Business Students Association, a student club. It is ""one serious option where people can go and feel supported, feel like they know everyone, and feel like everyone is their friend,"" Phillips said.</p>
<p>In his first year Phillips took part in a team-building weekend retreat in Napa and fielded questions from prospective MBA students during Admit Weekend about being black at Stanford. Other BBSA members have helped undergraduates interested in business careers polish their resumes and hone their interview skills.</p>
<p>There's also time for fun: The guys spent an evening out at dinner and clubbing in Oakland, while women of the BBSA gathered at a member's apartment to bond around cocktails and dessert.</p>
<p>The group that has been an integral part of Stanford life for Phillips and hundreds of other black students during the past quarter century is moving into the future with its old traditions intact and new goals underway. Its most ambitious effort of the year came in late April during Gathering 25, a two-day conference featuring speakers, workshops, and memories to celebrate the club's 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>
<p>The event drew about 200 people, including about 40 alums from around the country. As a show of enthusiasm and solidarity, about two dozen black members of the MBA class of 2008 made a pact to return to the conference every year.</p>
<p>Gathering 25 kicked off on April 25 with a keynote speech by Mellody Hobson, who described her rise through Chicago-based Ariel Investments to become president of that black-owned investment firm at age 30. Johnathan Rodgers, president and CEO of TV One — the cable channel that targets African Americans with the jaunty ""I See Black People"" advertising campaign — detailed the business strategy of the nation's sole black-owned broadcast company. Jim Phills and Roderick Kramer, members of the Stanford GSB organizational behavior faculty, talked about power in the workplace.</p>
<p>""Get us all in one room, and you see a big community here,"" said conference co-chair Rukaiyah Adams, MBA '08, about the scene that was created when all current black MBA students came up on stage for recognition. ""If you take a picture of the 50 black students who are here now, it makes a visual reminder that we have done well.""</p>
<p>The association got its start in the early 1980s when the number of black students in the business school reached ""a critical mass,"" said former BBSA member Bruce Thompson, MBA '84.</p>
<p>Never mind that only a handful of the 600 first- and second-year students attending business school at that time were black. ""We are not talking huge numbers,"" Thompson explained, ""but relative to what had been there in prior years, it was a substantial contingent.""</p>
<p>""I think there was a general feeling that we needed to have our own voice, as part of the business school and as part of the broader community.""</p>
<p>The year it was formed, the BBSA established an annual conference — which remains the oldest student-led conference at the business school. That event included a job fair, which at its peak drew representatives from as many as 30 companies and black Stanford grads, including Thompson, to recruit and provide support, advice, or mentoring to students. The job fair was discontinued in the 1990s.</p>
<p>For Art May, MBA '89, owner and principal of residential real estate development firm Keystone Development Group, ""The bond with other BBSA members is one of the stronger bonds"" from his Stanford years. ""I do business with them and have a long network of working together with black alums.""</p>
<p>Creating relationships remains one of the club's most important functions. This year about 30 second-year club members took part in the annual retreat held at a Napa hotel, said Chimeka Thomas, MBA '08.</p>
<p>During one exercise, participants jotted a professional or personal fear or concern on a piece of paper and placed it in a hat. The students closed their eyes and listened as the group's leader read each note aloud. ""When he read something off that related to you, you opened your eyes, and you look at the other people in the room whose eyes are open too,"" Thomas said. ""You don't move. No one says anything. It's just a way to understand that there are other people who are probably having the same concerns as you.""</p>
<p>Today the BBSA is also cultivating non-black club members. About 20 percent of the 75 current members are not minorities. Some are international students wanting to learn more about the black American experience. Others are non-black classmates eager to make new friends and expand their personal horizons.</p>
<p>""It's been a nice thing to share,"" said Thomas.</p>
<p>That strategy helps both sides learn about the realities of business today. ""If you really want to excel, you have to learn how to have cross-cultural conversations. There's much more mixing in society in general. I think it is for the better,"" said Adams, who is black and also a member of the Jewish Students Business Association.</p>
<p>David Silver, MBA '08, who is white and Jewish, chairs the BBSA's technology committee. While he considers being active in the group an important way to prepare for the reality of today's workforce, Silver said he's most enjoyed the BBSA's social side. He attended the fall weekend retreat and got to meet Thomas Adams, MBA'95 and a former eBay executive who hosted a BBSA reception at his home last year.</p>
<p>""It's inspirational to hear someone like that speak,"" Silver said. ""He's a fantastic role model for me, and for anybody at the GSB.""</p>

",143,"<p>Philanthropist and entrepreneur Jeff Skoll, the first president of eBay and the founder of the Skoll Foundation, the Skoll Global Threats Fund, and Participant Media, will be the first-ever guest speaker to address a Stanford Graduate School of Business graduation ceremony on June 12, 2010.</p>
<p>The Skoll speech will start a new tradition at the annual business school degree ceremony. ""Our students asked us for an inspirational speaker on this important day to help them envision the roles they may undertake to change lives, change organizations, and change the world through managed organizations of all kinds,"" said Garth Saloner, Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""I can't think of anyone better to model the life of meaning and impact we want our students to pursue than Jeff Skoll. He built a remarkable organization at eBay, and now has gone on to have an enormous impact on social issues through both his film and his philanthropic work.""</p>
<p>A 1995 graduate of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Skoll put his management skills to work as the first employee and president of eBay Inc. After eBay's success, he launched the Skoll Foundation in 1999. It quickly became the world's largest foundation for social entrepreneurship, driving large-scale change by investing in, connecting and celebrating social entrepreneurs and other innovators dedicated to solving the world's most pressing problems. The Foundation now supports more than 60 organizations around the world doing innovative work on environmental sustainability, public health, conflict resolution and more. Skoll's latest endeavor, the Skoll Global Threats Fund, launched in 2009, aims to identify and support solutions for tackling climate change, water scarcity, pandemics, nuclear proliferation, and Middle East conflict.</p>
<p>Skoll also believes in the power of media and a story well told to raise consciousness and compel social change. Skoll founded Participant Media in 2004, which has since created a number of feature and documentary films focused on social issues, including, among others, the Oscar-winner An Inconvenient Truth, Food Inc., Charlie Wilson's War, Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Soloist, The Kite Runner and The Informant! All aim to bring social issues to a broader audience and inspire people to action. Participant Media also celebrated its 2010 Oscar documentary winner, The Cove, which detailed the controversial dolphin hunt in Japan.</p>
<p>Jeff Skoll earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto in 1987. After founding a computer consulting business, he returned to school for his MBA at Stanford to enhance his management skills. He worked briefly for Knight-Ridder prior to joining eBay. Barron's recently named Skoll #2 among the Top 25 Philanthropists based on impact in 2009. He was named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of the Year (2006), received Wired Magazine's Rave Award, and made BusinessWeek's list of most innovative philanthropists. In 2009, The Producers Guild of America awarded him the Visionary Award, and Global Green USA bestowed its Entertainment Industry Environmental Leadership Award on him. Skoll also holds an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto and an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Santa Clara University.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,,,,Career & Success | Social Innovation | Nonprofit,,,eBay,MBA,,,,,Katie Pandes
1,3857,2/1/97 0:00,Motivating Others Keeps Careers Alive,37,news/headlines/1997arbuckleaward.shtml,Former Boeing CEO calls for management education that forces students to think across functional disciplines and hone critical thinking skills. ,144,"<p>Understanding the human side of management and developing the ability to positively influence others are key elements in determining business success, said Frank Shrontz, Sloan '70, the quietly effective leader of the Boeing Company for over a decade and the 1997 Arbuckle Award winner.</p>
<p>""I've seen many outstanding functional performers at Boeing, particularly engineers, peak out two-thirds of the way through their careers because they lack the skills to motivate others,"" Shrontz said at the award ceremony in March. Shrontz rejects the idea, however, that one particular leadership style is essential for success. ""How else can you explain a quiet, legal type running a high-technology company?"" asked Shrontz, who earned a law degree from the University of Idaho.</p>
<p>A Boeing man for most of his life, Shrontz joined the firm in 1958, taking his only leave in 1973 to serve three and one-half years as assistant secretary of the Air Force and later of the U.S. Defense Department. In 1985, Shrontz became president of the firm, the world's leading jetliner manufacturer. He became CEO in 1986 and chairman of the board in 1988. He stepped down in 1996.</p>
<p>Over the years, Boeing has been credited for helping improve the U.S. balance of payments and criticized for its effect on the economy of Washington's Puget Sound area when business downturns occasionally forced layoffs. Today, spurred by the fuel-efficient 777 model, developed on Shrontz's watch, Boeing has a backlog of orders.</p>
<p>Accepting the award, Shrontz urged business leaders to not shy away from taking risks and to recognize the value of continuous process improvement. He also called for management education that forces young managers to think across functional disciplines, hones logical thinking skills, and teaches strategic thinking skills.</p>
<p>""At Boeing, we can identify a number of good leaders to run the company operations on a current basis. It's much more difficult to identify executives with ability or even the desire to think about the opportunities and challenges 20 years out. Yet strategic thinking is probably where senior leaders can make the greatest contribution in both the profit and nonprofit areas,"" he said.</p>
<p>Shrontz is concerned about the ability of KÐ12 public school systems in the United States to ""meet the demands of the increasingly sophisticated design and production processes being put in place by American industry."" Improving KÐ12 public education is key to the country's success, he said. ""There is no more critical effort to ensure our future.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,,,,Leadership,,,,MSx,,,,,Barbara Buell
1,4132,2/20/09 0:00,"Michael Shanahan, MBA '65, Honored with 2009 Arbuckle Award",59,news/headlines/arbuckle_09.html,"The Capital Research and Management Co. Chairman Emeritus is the 39th leader to receive the award, presented by Stanford GSB Alumni Association.",144,"<p>Capital Research and Management Co. Chairman Emeritus R. Michael Shanahan, who helped his firm blossom into one of the three largest U.S. mutual fund companies and nurtured such startups as Advanced Micro Devices and Sequoia Capital, was presented with the prestigious 2009 Arbuckle Award by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association on February 19.</p>
<p>In becoming the 39<sup>th</sup> leader to receive the award, Shanahan, MBA '65, explained to the audience how some of today's financial crises could have been averted if more people knew what his Stanford professors did four decades ago. He recalls learning that quantitative methods are not always ideal because some variables are difficult to quantify, making their statistics unclear.</p>
<p>""As one professor said, 'Use quantitative methods to develop insights, not to substitute for them.' That has held me in good stead for a long time.""</p>
<p>Shanahan said Wall Street often was preoccupied with measurable statistics, looking at investment models rather than analyzing the details that could lead those investments to crumble. ""Risk is, after all, a four-letter word.""</p>
<p>In introducing Shanahan, John G. McDonald, Stanford Investors Professor of Finance at the Business School, described how Shanahan started as an analyst at Capital in 1965, then became research director in 1968 and started making venture capital investments in companies like AMD. McDonald said Sequoia Capital, a leading venture capital firm in Menlo Park, was incubated at Capital. Today clients of subsidiaries of the Capital Group Companies have assets of over one trillion dollars.</p>
<p>McDonald, who has known Shanahan since they were undergraduates, praised his friend's honesty, integrity, generosity, deep humility, and love of Stanford. The humility was particularly evident as Shanahan discussed his time at Stanford and his decision to work for Capital.</p>
<p>Shanahan explained how his service in the Navy after receiving his AB from Stanford in 1960 helped him appreciate what he missed in his undergraduate years. When he was a freshman in 1956, Shanahan recalled, he had a Navy scholarship and an appointment as an officer awaiting him after graduation, and he quickly realized that he needed to make only a modest effort to get his degree.</p>
<p>""I proceeded to invest the near minimum and missed a tremendous opportunity,"" he said. ""Early in my Navy career, I discovered that many of my fellow junior officers had distinguished themselves more by what they had learned and the effort that they expended than by the name or the status of the college that they came from. It didn't take me long to see my mistake.""</p>
<p>In late 1962, Shanahan decoded a message from the Bureau of Naval Personnel suggesting that because of developments in Vietnam, naval officers who normally should have the option to go into the reserves after three years of service — such as Shanahan —  should be denied that option unless they planned to go to graduate school or got hired by a defense contractor. ""So, you guessed it: I applied to 10 business schools and 10 defense contractors.""</p>
<p>Shanahan had good reason to embrace his education far more once Stanford accepted him in the Graduate School of Business. Thanks to the efforts of the late Dean Ernest C. Arbuckle, after whom the award is named, the school had increased in stature. Shanahan said the class of '65 was among the first to benefit from Arbuckle's drive to recruit faculty and students, revise the curriculum, and provide intensive staff support.</p>
<p>""I needed all the help he devised,"" Shanahan said.</p>
<p>He recalled that the MBA program's focus was on business enterprises, but that Arbuckle stressed the importance of studying the people filling those jobs, rather than just the typical analysis of a job's function within the enterprise. ""It was a revelation—not overwhelmingly popular, but overwhelmingly successful.""</p>
<p>Shanahan said that without his experience analyzing processes and people at the GSB, he would never have considered working at a place such as Capital Research. But he realized that the work there would involve analytics similar to those he had studied.</p>
<p>""In all candor,"" he said, ""I chose Capital because it was the easiest one to leave. My job was to go out and interview a bunch of companies and get to know their managers real well. I figured if I was any good, one of them at least would be willing to hire me if it didn't work out at Capital.""</p>
<p>He never took the option. ""I spent 44 years there,"" Shanahan said.</p>
<p>The Arbuckle Award, which recognizes excellence in management leadership, has previously been given to such people as former Secretary of State George Shultz, investor and banker John Scully, MBA '68. and longtime Intel leader Andy Grove, lecturer in business at the School.</p>
<p>""I am doubly honored to be included in a list of such distinguished business leaders,"" Shanahan said.</p>

1,5741,1/28/12 0:00,Environmental Sustainability Drives Student Interest in Farming,63,news/headlines/farming-interest.html,"Sustainability now also means treating farmworkers well, an avocado grower tells MBA students interested in food and agriculture resource management.",149,"<p>Is it bad to eat meat? What incentives help people manage land in sustainable ways? What kind of agriculture works best in developing countries? Why are avocados so expensive?</p>
<p>About 100 students at Stanford's Graduate School of Business have formed the Food and Agriculture Resource Management Club, or FARM Club, to explore these questions.</p>
<p>The club was started in spring 2010 by students who wanted to know more about careers in agriculture, said Michelle Paratore, Class of 2012, one of the club's presidents. Some want to work for companies that sell healthy food, for example; others want to learn more about investing in farmland. Although many of the members are also interested in food issues in their personal lives, the club's focus is on the industry and careers.</p>
<p>One of the club's regular activities is hosting guest speakers. Recently, members heard Jamie Johnson, a fourth-generation California farmer who grows avocados at Rancho Simpatica in Fillmore, Calif., explain the challenges facing his industry. Johnson's farm produces 5 million to 8 million pounds of avocados per year, a small percentage of those grown in California. Johnson is also vice chairman of the Hass Avocado Board and a member of the California Avocado Commission Marketing Committee.</p>
<p>Stores that sell avocados face high risks and high rewards. Profit margins are high, and consumers who buy avocados tend to buy other products as well. But avocados go bad fairly quickly, so grocers risk losing all their investment if the avocados don't sell.</p>
<p>Like other California farmers, avocado growers struggle with the scarcity of land, water, and labor, Johnson said. Farmland prices in the United States are at historic highs. California's water battles, which pit urban water users against rural, and northern California against southern, have not been resolved — and avocados require a lot of water to grow in California.</p>
<p>Finally, labor costs are an issue. Johnson said he takes pride in paying fair wages and providing health care to his workers. But increasing government attention to the immigration status of farm workers is making it more difficult to find workers to pick the crops.</p>
<p>The upside to growing avocados in the United States is that the market is growing. Area growers are looking to the food service industry for increased sales.</p>
<p>Johnson gave students a look at other trends affecting the avocado industry.</p>
<p>For example, he is working with the Hass Avocado Board, which is funded by an assessment of 2.5 cents per pound of avocados produced or handled in the United States, to market the health benefits of avocados. One of the group's goals is to support research showing the health benefits of avocados, since without proof they can't make health claims.</p>
<p>""I know I have a product that's a super food. I know that if you eat an avocado, its good for you. But how can I prove that?"" Johnson asked.</p>
<p>A boon for sellers in recent years has been the ability to ripen avocados before selling them, in much the same way that bananas are ripened before sale. ""The ripening process changed our business,"" Johnson said. ""It allows us to sell a whole lot more avocados.""</p>
<p>The current focus on organic and sustainable food is also changing demand. Johnson said it's not clear that consumers are willing to pay the extra costs required for organic food. He is, however, seeing a trend toward sustainability, which includes treating farm workers well and maintaining good relationships with the community. ""People are demanding that not only is their food safe and regulated, but also that they're treating people humanely,"" he said. In addition to consumers, some large buyers are starting to demand this,</p>
<p>Johnson also said efficient farming — in which farmers get the highest nutritional output for the least expenditure of water and other resources — is likely to become increasingly important.</p>
