Fellowships are available for exceptional, self-sponsored applicants with need.",198,"<p>On the heels of the successful completion of the first 9-week certificate program in innovation and entrepreneurship outside its California campus, Stanford Graduate School of Business is now accepting applications for <a href=""/programs/stanford-ignite/global-locations/bangalore"">Stanford Ignite - Bangalore 2014</a>. Classes will meet on extended weekends from April 4 through June 8, 2014. The deadline for applications is November 22, 2013.</p>
<p>""Just a few weeks ago, we presented certificates of completion to an incredibly talented cohort of 41 smart and energetic working professionals in such fields as medicine, law, engineering, and robotics,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/yossi-feinberg"">Yossi Feinberg</a>, John G. McCoy-Banc One Professor of Economics and faculty director of Stanford Ignite. ""These individuals embody the intent of the Stanford Ignite program to drive economic growth through entrepreneurship by teaching innovators, both entrepreneurs and 'intrapreneurs,' the business skills to bring their ideas to market. They've absolutely set a high bar for the next batch of participants.""</p>
<p>The site of the first in a series of Stanford Ignite programs to be offered around the globe, the inaugural Stanford Ignite-Bangalore program began on August 10 and completed on October 7, meeting at a state-of-the-art facility made available by Infosys.</p>
<p>""Being part of the maiden Ignite program in Bangalore was a transformational experience for me,"" said participant Abhisarika Das, Director, KLoc Technologies Pvt. Ltd. ""It empowered me with the knowledge to drive innovation in my organization, inspire my team to be passionate about customer satisfaction, and create a culture of continuous improvement.""</p>
<p>In contrast to the program just completed, the timing of the 2014 program was shifted to spring to maximize faculty availability. The part-time course also will now meet on extended weekends to accommodate participants from elsewhere in India.</p>
<h2>Financial support</h2>
<p>Full-tuition fellowships will be available to a small number of exceptional self-sponsored applicants who demonstrate financial need. Applicants must first be accepted into the program before applying for the fellowship. Tuition fee of US$8,350 includes course materials, program events, and lunch and dinner for evening and Saturday sessions.</p>
<p>Aimed at nonbusiness technical professionals, Stanford Ignite draws on the same world-class Stanford GSB faculty who teach in the MBA Program, and is designed to deliver the same highly personal and innovative instruction that executives and students at Stanford experience. Classes are taught by Stanford GSB professors on the ground, as well as faculty beamed in from Silicon Valley by high-definition educational technology.</p>
<p>The course teaches innovators in India how to formulate, develop, and commercialize their ideas. Prominent executives and corporate, venture, and angel investors participate as guest speakers, expert panelists, and business mentors to provide candid feedback on team projects. Participants expect to learn core business skills and experience working in a team to evaluate and develop ideas into a business plan.</p>
<p>Intended for individuals who do not already have graduate business training, Stanford Ignite participants are currently enrolled students in master's, PhD, MD, or post-doctoral programs studying nonbusiness subjects; or are technical professionals with a minimum of a bachelor's (BA or BS) degree from a regionally accredited institution.</p>
<p>""In aggregate, Stanford Ignite participants have started over 80 successful companies since the program was first introduced at Stanford in 2007,"" said Bethany Coates, associate dean and director of Stanford Global Innovation Programs, who administers the Stanford Ignite program. ""The Bangalore 'Igniters' join a global network of high-impact innovators.""</p>

1,82341,2/21/14 0:00,Stanford Launches University-Wide Global Development and Poverty Research Initiative,84,news/headlines/stanford-launches-university-wide-global-development-poverty-research-initiative,$10 million grant program is part of the Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies.,99,"<p>Global poverty is a profound and persistent problem: More than a billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, according to the World Bank. While many Stanford researchers dedicate their work to alleviating poverty, a new university-wide initiative promises them more support.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href=""https://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies</a> (SEED), the Global Development and Poverty Initiative (GDP) will make grants available to Stanford faculty across the university who take a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to combating poverty. SEED, which seeks to alleviate poverty by stimulating the creation of economic opportunities through innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of businesses, was established in 2011 through a generous gift from Robert King, MBA '60, and his wife, Dorothy.</p>
<p>The GDP Initiative recognizes that the complex challenges faced by the poor in developing economies are multifaceted and require the engagement of experts from a variety of disciplines such as health or public policy. The new initiative will solicit proposals from faculty across the Stanford campus to develop innovative approaches to addressing economic development and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>Through complementary areas of focus, GDP grants and other SEED initiatives will stimulate research, novel interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions to problems of global poverty and development.</p>
<p>The initiative — which is launching with $10 million in initial funding — will also support teaching and efforts to apply research findings to on-the-ground training and practical problems affecting global poverty. The new grant initiative will be administered by SEED in collaboration with Stanford's <a href=""http://fsi.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies</a> (FSI).</p>
<p>""The overarching goal is to change people's lives and to build Stanford's capacity to play a role in that crucial effort,"" said Stanford University President John Hennessy.</p>
<p>""Faculty and students will pursue answers to crucial questions that are essential to our understanding of how to reduce global poverty and promote economic development,"" said GDP co-chair Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, FSI's director and the Stanley Morrison Professor of Law. ""Governance and the rule of law, education, health, and food security — all of these issues can be essential for entrepreneurship to thrive.""</p>
<p>SEED is housed at the Graduate School of Business, and focuses on driving growth through entrepreneurship and scaling established enterprises to create jobs and improve lives. SEED engages in research, teaching and especially on-the-ground training and mentoring for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>""The GDP initiative enhances SEED's objective by deepening our understanding of the broader context for entrepreneurship and management in developing economies,"" said GDP co-chair <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/jesper-b-sorensen"">Jesper B. Sørensen</a>, who is also SEED faculty director and the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior. ""By strengthening Stanford's ability to address topics such as health, for example, GDP promises to multiply the impact of SEED's efforts.""</p>
<p>SEED's other activities will also provide an important supplement to GDP projects. In particular, SEED's presence in developing countries — including establishing regional centers like the one opened in Ghana in 2013 — can help facilitate the engagement of GDP projects with local sources in developing economies.</p>
<h2>Faculty Letters of Inquiry Due March 14</h2>
<p>GDP co-chairs Sørensen and Cuéllar will lead a council of faculty from across campus appointed by the president and provost. They will serve renewable two-to-three-year terms. The council will solicit and evaluate grant proposals, advise on awards, monitor progress and facilitate cross-disciplinary engagement.</p>
<p>Initial letters of inquiry will be due March 14. Invitations to submit full proposals (along with additional instructions on how to prepare the proposals) will be issued by April 2, and full proposals will be due by May 1. Awards will be announced before the end of the spring quarter.</p>
<h2>Grant Criteria</h2>
<p>There will be two types of GDP grants. The main emphasis is on Capacity-Building Research Grants for substantial projects, requiring a minimum of $250,000 and which may take up to 5 years to complete. Recipients will be required to make presentations about their research at an annual, public conference hosted by the GDP initiative.</p>
<p>The GDP also will award smaller Preliminary Research Grants not to exceed $30,000 or more than one year.</p>
<p>Collaborative, multi-faculty proposals are not mandatory but will be strongly encouraged, said Cuéllar. Proposals will be evaluated case-by-case by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substantive focus on global poverty</li>
<li>Potential practical applications</li>
<li>Regional or cross-national impact</li>
<li>Building Stanford's capacity</li>
<li>Scholarly merit</li>
<li>Long-term strategy and budget plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Letters of inquiry for both Capacity-Building Research Grants and Preliminary Research Grants should be submitted <a href=""https://seed.stanford.edu/research/request-proposals"" target=""_blank"">online</a>.</p>

1,82201,1/31/14 0:00,Stanford Symposium Features Innovative Ideas for the Future of U.S. Public Sector Pensions,90,news/headlines/stanford-symposium-features-innovative-ideas-future-us-public-sector-pensions,Event is culmination of massive open online course about retirement and pensions.,81,"<p>The top performers out of 44,000 participants in the first massive open online course (MOOC) offered by Stanford Graduate School of Business converged at Stanford on Friday, January 24, 2014, to present during a live symposium titled ""Innovative Ideas for the Future of U.S. Public Sector Pensions.""</p>
<p>These participants — from California, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Oregon, and Pennsylvania — were from high-performing teams that took part in <a href=""http://online.stanford.edu/course/rauh-finance"" target=""_blank"">The Finance of Retirement and Pensions</a>, an open online course created and led by Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/joshua-d-rauh"">Joshua Rauh</a>. The event was co-hosted by the <a href=""http://www.hoover.org/"" target=""_blank"">Hoover Institution</a>, which paid for travel-related expenses to allow a representative from each team to come to Stanford for the event.</p>
<p>""People are more responsible for preparing for their own retirement than ever before, and I believe the class has given participants the knowledge to make better financial decisions for themselves and also to be more informed participants in public policy debates,"" said Rauh.</p>
<p>Chief among the public policy debates that concern Rauh are those relating to public sector pensions, to which he dedicated the second half of the course, including the livestreamed, on-campus symposium. During the event, he elaborated that underfunded public pension systems ""are threatening to eat away at the governments' ability to provide vital public services,"" among other dangers. His concern was clearly shared by the course participants, a majority of whom indicated in a survey that they are worried about the impact of government budget problems on their taxes and on municipal and state governments' ability to fulfill their obligations.</p>
<p>Six teams were chosen to present at the symposium based on the course's final project, an analysis of a state or local pension system that covers public employees, including policy recommendations about how to improve those plans. The winning proposals were selected through a rigorous process as having the most promising ideas to address trillions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities that are threatening the financial future of U.S. state and local governments.</p>
<p>The proposals addressed challenges faced by the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS); Cook County Pension Fund, Illinois; Police and Fire Pension Fund, Jacksonville, Florida; Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS); State of Oregon Public Employees Retirement System; and the Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System.</p>
<p>While there were some significant differences among the recommendations brought forward, many of the participants proposed adjustments to the retirement age, the conversion of defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans (or the creation of hybrid plans), reductions in money management fees, changes to the investment mix, and adjustments to the discount rates used to calculate future streams of income.</p>
<p>A panel of Stanford pension and finance experts was on hand during the symposium to discuss the public pension crisis and the merits of the various proposals. The panelists supported many of the recommendations, while noting the practical realities of political reform. As Stanford lecturer and president of Govern for California <a href=""http://siepr.stanford.edu/peopleprofile/3075"" target=""_blank"">David Crane</a> observed, there were many innovative ideas brought to light, but a fundamental issue is motivation for change. ""This pension problem can continue for a long time without anybody doing anything,"" he said. ""We need to come up with a clever way to motivate people to make change happen."" Otherwise, it ""will clobber the next generation.""</p>
<h2>Top Pension Reform Proposals</h2>
<h3>California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS)</h3>
<p>With over $170 billion in assets and 860,000 current employees or retirees linked to CalSTRS, the system is the nation's second-largest public pension fund. The key operational reform recommended by the symposium team was a voluntary buyout of pension liabilities via a lump-sum payment to current employees, thereby reducing their future benefits and improving the system's finances. The team also recommended a fundamental structural reform that would eliminate the defined benefit plan and transition it to a hybrid defined benefit/defined contribution plan for all future employees, while extending the retirement age in a phased manner.</p>
<h3>Cook County Pension Fund, Illinois</h3>
<p>This five-person team reverse-engineered the cash flows of the pension fund and estimated its unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) to be $9.4 billion. After running simulations that tested how different measures would help reduce unfunded liabilities over the next 100 years, the team recommended an optimal combination of measurements that included some benefit reductions (increased retirement age, reduced cost of living adjustments, changes to pensionable salary, and discontinuation of healthcare), as well as changes in the annual required contribution calculation that would guarantee the solvency of the fund in the long term.</p>
<h3>Police and Fire Pension Fund, Jacksonville, Florida</h3>
<p>This four-person team analyzed the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund, which is only 39% funded, and has an unfunded liability of $1.7 billion that has grown over 13 times since 2000. The team has proposed a comprehensive package of reforms, with the cornerstone being a ""Freeze & 40"" policy that would freeze the current defined benefit pension system and replace it with a robust, portable, and immediately vesting defined contribution plan for current employees. In addition, the team recommended changes to the current paradigm of fixed cost-of-living benefit adjustments and large reductions in fund investment management expense fees.</p>
<h3>Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS)</h3>
<p>This top team analyzed the Mississippi PERS and recommended a constitutional amendment that would require the PERS Board to invest its funds only in index funds, stable value funds, and cash or cash equivalents, a step the team believes would save nearly 1% of net assets annually; revert benefit accrual rates, employee contribution rates, and cost of living adjustments to those that were in place prior to 1999; increase the normal retirement age to 62 and base final earnings on a 4-year average; and require the legislature to bring public employee salaries up to the average levels of the contiguous states (which are about 26% and 14% higher for non-teaching and teaching positions, respectively).</p>
<h3>State of Oregon Public Employees Retirement System</h3>
<p>The Oregon PERS system has an unfunded liability of $11 billion that is unsustainable, according to the team that analyzed it. The team proposed reforms that would result in savings of $3.35 billion, including capping the maximum retiree benefit to 90% of final annual salary (FAS); disallowing vacation and sick pay to be calculated as part of FAS; and requiring 10 years of service for cost of living adjustment eligibility. To generate income, the team recommended modifying current legislation to eliminate selected tax refunds until the UAAL reaches zero. They also proposed long-term reforms such as adjusting the investment mix from 75% equity to a more balanced portfolio and changing the discount rate from 8% to 6%.</p>
<h3>Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS)</h3>
<p>The Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System serves over 600,000 individuals and is 66.4% funded, with a UAAL of $29.5 billion. The team focused on legislative, funding, performance, and investing trends beginning in 2001 to understand the source of the UAAL, and developed recommendations to reduce or eliminate it through changes to PSERS' governance, risk strategy, reporting, revenue generation, fees, and plan features. Some specific proposals include the introduction of a natural gas fracking tax and the appointment of a chief risk officer. Team members have recently shared their findings with school districts, state and federal legislators, and PSERS officials.</p>
<p>With these many proposals on the table, Joshua Rauh concluded the symposium with the observation that ""pressure to make changes comes when people feel the squeeze on services"" and the hope that all of the course participants will continue to think about how to effect change within their state and local governments.</p>

<p>The report, ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.law.stanford.edu/publications/avoiding-sunstroke"">Avoiding Sunstroke: Assessing National Competitiveness in the Global Solar Race</a>,"" reflects the conclusions of some 20 top executives of solar companies from five countries who met at Stanford for an unusual day-long scenario-planning exercise to try to answer a crucial question about the small but rapidly growing solar industry: What will it look like in 2025? Which sorts of companies, and which countries, will do what?</p>
<p>The report, detailing the views of the executives who attended, says the global solar industry is likely to develop based on a pattern of ""glocalization"": A handful of global companies will dominate the industry, and they will locate different parts of their businesses in different countries based on their sense of where they can make the most money. That conclusion belies a claim, heard often in industry and policy circles, that China has ""won"" the solar industry and that other countries — the U.S., Germany, and others — have ""lost"" it. But this ""glocal"" view of the solar industry's growth suggests that many markets around the world have critical — and potentially profitable — roles to play as solar technologies and markets evolve.</p>
<p>This report, like the workshop on which it's based, is qualitative rather than quantitative. It does not endorse the views of those at the workshop. It is intended to provide a snapshot of what one influential and representative slice of the global solar industry thinks about the industry's future. Each of the scenarios it explores is a plausible future.</p>
<p>The workshop was organized by Stanford's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, a joint initiative of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.law.stanford.edu/"">Stanford Law School</a> and Stanford Graduate School of Business, and the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bmu.de/en/"">German Federal Ministry for the Environment</a>. Jeffrey Ball, scholar-in-residence at the Steyer-Taylor Center, and Jonas Meckling, senior adviser at the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, wrote the report.</p>
<p>Top executives from solar companies based in China, Germany, Italy, Korea and the U.S. participated in the workshop. They lead companies that produce polysilicon, solar panels, inverters and other components; that lease solar systems to consumers; that finance solar installations; and more. PwC U.S. helped structure and moderate the workshop's scenario-planning sessions.</p>
<p>The executives at the workshop charted how the industry might develop in four scenarios that revolve around two key factors: the level of penetration of solar energy in overall power markets, and the extent to which national solar markets are open or closed to foreign-based companies and to the integration of solar power into the national energy mix.</p>
<h2>A Snapshot of Four Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Global Sun</h3>
<p>Solar power generates more than 8% of global electricity, roughly 25 times the current level, and national barriers to its expansion are low. Major oil, power, chemical and electronics companies enter the industry. China and Korea dominate in solar manufacturing. The U.S. and Germany dominate in technological innovation.</p>
<h3>Solar Systems</h3>
<p>Solar produces more than 8% of global electricity, but countries impose protectionist measures that make costs higher than they otherwise might be. China is triumphant, tapping its big domestic solar market. In the U.S., the military is a major solar player.</p>
<h3>Sunblock</h3>
<p>Solar generates less than 1% of global electricity, and barriers in many nations break it up into a patchwork of limited local markets. One impediment: Utilities in many countries enact policies that many consumers perceive as raising solar energy's costs.</p>
<h3>Total Eclipse</h3>
<p>Solar is utterly insignificant. It produces less than 1% of global power; countries don't care enough about it even to impose barriers to try to grab its spoils. Solar grows only in markets with severely underdeveloped conventional electricity systems. Among them: many African countries, and India.</p>
<p>The ""glocal"" view of the solar industry detailed in the report suggests several takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar manufacturing is likely to concentrate among a handful of global companies. They might be based in China or other Asian markets; they might be based in Europe or the U.S.</li>
<li>Regardless of where these companies are headquartered, they're likely to do much of their manufacturing in Asia. They're likely to do the final manufacturing step – assembling their actual solar modules – in end markets where domestic solar demand is large enough to justify an assembly plant.</li>
<li>Several wild cards could change the calculus about where in the world it's most profitable for a global solar manufacturer to manufacture: regional differences in energy prices, raw-material costs and wages; global transportation costs; and technological advances that reduce the need for factory-floor labor or that radically change the kind of photovoltaic device that the market wants.</li>
<li>Manufacturing is only one piece of the solar business. Other pieces – research and development, manufacturing of tooling, commercialization of new technologies, financing, marketing, and the installation and maintenance of solar projects – offer broad opportunities for countries to play to their comparative strengths.</li>
