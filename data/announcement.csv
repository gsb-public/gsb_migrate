1,4505,7/1/11 0:00,Summer Programs Keep the Business School Busy,45,news/headlines/summer_programs_2011.html,"Nearly 500 students graduated in June, but their departure doesn't mean Stanford GSB's Knight Management Center is standing empty.",130,"<p>Nearly 500 students graduated in June, but their departure doesn't mean the Stanford Graduate School of Business' Knight Management Center is standing empty.</p>
<p>At least 1,600 people will be drawn to campus between June and August to attend executive programs, summer institutes, conferences, and alumni events that also will bring more than 50 faculty members back into the classroom.</p>
<p>Each week, participants attend programs that are designed for people from various professional backgrounds. Many summer sessions are executive programs for seasoned managers preparing to assume broader roles at their companies. There's also instruction for entrepreneurial students from non-business majors who are learning business fundamentals for the first time. About 53 Stanford GSB professors teach in various summer programs.</p>
<p>All that activity produces brisk business at the Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, where students relax in wooden rocking chairs and enjoy their sandwiches while tapping on their laptops, and Stanford GSB professors hold lunch-table discussions with summer program participants in the eatery's open-air lanai.</p>
<p>That's where Mike Fero headed during a mid-day break from the Summer Institute for Entrepreneurship. The popular program is designed to equip current non-business Stanford graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with the skills they'll need to turn innovative ideas into successful business ventures.</p>
<p>""It's basically showing me a little bit about what I have to know to be a CEO of a startup,"" said Fero, who has a PhD in physics and is learning accounting, finance, leadership, and negotiation skills. He hopes the knowledge and professional contacts gained during the program will help him in his quest to commercialize a technology to enable microbes to efficiently create biofuel.</p>
<p>""I'm learning so much that I never knew,"" said Fero, a postdoctoral student at the Stanford School of Medicine Department of Developmental Biology. ""It's very useful to come and get into the language of business. It's been an eye-opener.""</p>
<p>The month-long program attracts students and postdocs with backgrounds in engineering, medicine, science, humanities, education, or law. About 100 people are enrolled this year, up from 72 last summer.</p>
<p>The school's new Knight Center, which opened in April, is 80,000 square feet larger than Stanford GSB's former location, and the added size has enabled a jump in attendance for some summer programs. For example, the 600-seat CEMEX Auditorium — with about twice the capacity of the old Bishop Auditorium-accommodated nearly 500 educators and policy makers who came to a two-day Goldman Sachs/Stanford University Global Education Conference in June to hear how innovators around the world are aiming to boost student achievement. The gathering featured keynote luncheon speaker Cory Booker, the Stanford, Yale, and Oxford-educated mayor of Newark, N.J. who is well known for his support of education reform. Attendees listened to his speech while dining alfresco under a huge tent pitched in front of the Bass Center on the Town Square.</p>
<p>Some programs are aimed at alumni including the 203 people who arrived in June for the 25<sup>th</sup> reunion of the MBA Class of 1986. Their four-day event kicked off with a high-spirited welcome-back pajama party/frozen yogurt social as alums moved into the Schwab Residential Center for a reminder about what campus life is like. During the week attendees also learned from group discussions, including one led by George Parker, the Dean Witter Distinguished Professor of Finance, Emeritus, who related what it takes to serve on a corporate board of directors.</p>
<p>This year's Class of 1986 reunion drew a total of 308 alums and guests-an all-time record exceeding the 228 who attended the group's previous reunion.</p>
<p>Other Stanford GSB summer programs are customized to bolster the skills of specific professionals. In June, 36 people attended a three-day management program designed to help technology executives from Fortune 500 firms develop fresh thinking for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. And in August, Stanford GSB will host 35 participants in its <a href=""/exed/alp"">Advanced Leadership Program for Asian American Executives</a>.</p>
<p>During the entire summer, the school's Executive Education office is expected to host 14 programs ranging in length from two to 41 days, with nearly 700 participants scheduled to attend.</p>
<p>Cristina Ventura, a senior retail veteran who hails from Barcelona, is one of the 145 people from 33 countries attending the six week residential <a href=""/exed/sep/"">Stanford Executive Program</a>, the school's flagship executive program established in 1952. Ventura's goal is to learn more about the tech world because the former Asia Pacific retail director for the Prada Group is about to join technology giant Apple, where she will oversee the rollout of Apple retail stores throughout Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Interacting with other attendees who are experts in industries from aviation to health care has given Ventura ""another vision in life.""</p>
<p>She is learning about finance and ethics, reading more than 150 pages a day of business case studies, and listening as other participants share new developments in their industries. That bonding continues outside of the classroom as well. Ventura and her colleagues regularly meet up at 6am daily exercise workouts and recently took an excursion to San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>Ventura explained: ""Once you are inside a company, you just see that part of the company, that industry, that point of view. Being with people who are completely different in terms of culture, background, and expertise broadens you and makes you challenge every belief you had before, which I think is extremely important for any leader to keep improving.""</p>
<p>Not far away, Kelvin Limonte, a 2011 University of Miami music performance grad, is attending Stanford's Summer Institute for General Management, designed for people just beginning their careers. Through courses taught by GSB professors, group projects, and other activities, college juniors and seniors and recent college graduates get a solid grounding in business fundamentals. Other highlights of the month-long residential program included question and answer sessions with industry leaders from electric carmaker Tesla, organic foods firm Earthbound Farms, and internet heavyweight Yahoo.</p>
<p>Limonte, who aims to work for a non-profit that does educational outreach, is energized by a summer at Stanford GSB.</p>
<p>""Everyday I'm learning, not just from the faculty but also from the students who are from all over the world,"" he said. ""For me to be exposed to people from the Far East, or Europe — it's been a great learning experience. We have group projects and we all bring different things to the table. It's really cool how we work together.""</p>

1,4060,4/1/10 0:00,School Mourns Death of Second-year MBA Student Roanak Desai,59,news/headlines/Desaideath.html,"Roanak Desai, a member of the Class of 2010, died in a hospital in Maine April 3 after falling ill while on a trip to Africa and the Middle East.",145,"<p>Roanak Desai, a member of the Stanford MBA class of 2010, died in a hospital in Maine April 3 after falling ill while on a trip to Africa.</p>
<p>He had become ill last week while on a trip that included stops in Africa and the Middle East. During a flight to New York on his return trip, Desai became so ill that the plane made an emergency landing in Maine on Wednesday, March 31. He was admitted to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and died at the hospital on Saturday evening surrounded by family and friends. His death was related to complications from a severe malaria infection. He was 31 years old.</p>
<p>Devoted to his family, Desai is survived by his parents, Rekha and Valmik Desai and sister, Paayal Desai.</p>
<p>A memorial service and celebration of his life was held April 8 at the Arrillaga Alumni Center on the Stanford campus.</p>
<p>""It is still difficult to come to grips with the fact that such a thing has happened to someone so vibrant and so clearly on a path to have impact in the world,"" business school Dean Garth Saloner said in a note to the school community Saturday night announcing the death. ""Through his positive spirit, warm humor, generosity, leadership, and intellectual curiosity, Roanak embodied much of what we all love about the GSB. I am deeply saddened.""</p>
<p>Several hundred students, faculty and staff members gathered at the business school's Schwab Residential Center on Sunday night to honor his memory, chatting quietly with one another and writing notes to be passed on to the Desai family.</p>
<p>At the business school Desai was a member of the student View from the Top committee that identifies business leaders who address students about leadership issues. Earlier this academic year he had conducted interview-conversations with two of the speakers in the program, Kenneth Chenault, CEO of American Express, and Andrea Jung, CEO of Avon.</p>
<p>As a member of the student academic committee Desai had a role in presenting the 2009 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award to Prof. Ilya Strebulaev. In December Desai was a student leader of a study trip to India. He was an officer of the student Entrepreneur Club and part of the Global Management Program's Student Leadership Team.</p>
<p>Prior to entering the Stanford Graduate School of Business in the fall of 2008, Roanak Desai was vice president and global head of corporate development, as well as investor relations, working for Pramod Bhasin, CEO at Genpact Ltd. in New Delhi. He oversaw strategic initiatives, joint ventures, alliances, and merger and acquisition deals. He ran the strategic marketing group and oversaw operations for investment banking and private equity clients. Lastly, he spearheaded Genpact's IPO process and built its investor relations department. During those 3.5 years, Desai lived in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Prior to Genpact, he was with GE's Corporate merger and acquisition team for 2.5 years in Fairfield, Conn. where he worked on a wide range of deals including the acquisitions ofAmersham and Universal, and the sales of Genpact, Genworth, FGIC, GE Motors and Garrett Aviation. Desai began his career with JP Morgan's Investment Banking group in New York, working with financial services companies.</p>
<p>Born in Mumbai (Bombay), India, Desai was raised in Queens, NY, and was a U.S. citizen. He received his undergraduate degree in neurobiology from Harvard College in 2000. While at Harvard, Desai was a member of student organizations including Model Congress, the Prefect Program for peer advising, and the Eliot House Committee. He also volunteered at the Children's Hospital in Boston where he spent time weekly with children undergoing cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Upon graduation from Harvard, he continued to donate his time, working with Prep for Prep, an organization that identifies New York City's most promising students of color and prepares them for placement at independent schools in the city. He served on the alumni board of Trinity School in New York City where he had earned his high school diploma, volunteering as an alumni mentor through the Milken Scholars Program to help current scholars transition to college.</p>

1,82341,2/21/14 0:00,Stanford Launches Global Development and Poverty Research Initiative,68,news/headlines/stanford-launches-university-wide-global-development-poverty-research-initiative,$10 million grant program is part of the Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies.,99,"<p>Global poverty is a profound and persistent problem: More than a billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, according to the World Bank. While many Stanford researchers dedicate their work to alleviating poverty, a new university-wide initiative promises them more support.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href=""https://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies</a> (SEED), the Global Development and Poverty Initiative (GDP) will make grants available to Stanford faculty across the university who take a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to combating poverty. SEED, which seeks to alleviate poverty by stimulating the creation of economic opportunities through innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of businesses, was established in 2011 through a generous gift from Robert King, MBA '60, and his wife, Dorothy.</p>
<p>The GDP Initiative recognizes that the complex challenges faced by the poor in developing economies are multifaceted and require the engagement of experts from a variety of disciplines such as health or public policy. The new initiative will solicit proposals from faculty across the Stanford campus to develop innovative approaches to addressing economic development and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>Through complementary areas of focus, GDP grants and other SEED initiatives will stimulate research, novel interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions to problems of global poverty and development.</p>
<p>The initiative — which is launching with $10 million in initial funding — will also support teaching and efforts to apply research findings to on-the-ground training and practical problems affecting global poverty. The new grant initiative will be administered by SEED in collaboration with Stanford's <a href=""http://fsi.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies</a> (FSI).</p>
<p>""The overarching goal is to change people's lives and to build Stanford's capacity to play a role in that crucial effort,"" said Stanford University President John Hennessy.</p>
<p>""Faculty and students will pursue answers to crucial questions that are essential to our understanding of how to reduce global poverty and promote economic development,"" said GDP co-chair Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, FSI's director and the Stanley Morrison Professor of Law. ""Governance and the rule of law, education, health, and food security — all of these issues can be essential for entrepreneurship to thrive.""</p>
<p>SEED is housed at the Graduate School of Business, and focuses on driving growth through entrepreneurship and scaling established enterprises to create jobs and improve lives. SEED engages in research, teaching and especially on-the-ground training and mentoring for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>""The GDP initiative enhances SEED's objective by deepening our understanding of the broader context for entrepreneurship and management in developing economies,"" said GDP co-chair <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/jesper-b-sorensen"">Jesper B. Sørensen</a>, who is also SEED faculty director and the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior. ""By strengthening Stanford's ability to address topics such as health, for example, GDP promises to multiply the impact of SEED's efforts.""</p>
<p>SEED's other activities will also provide an important supplement to GDP projects. In particular, SEED's presence in developing countries — including establishing regional centers like the one opened in Ghana in 2013 — can help facilitate the engagement of GDP projects with local sources in developing economies.</p>
<h2>Faculty Letters of Inquiry Due March 14</h2>
<p>GDP co-chairs Sørensen and Cuéllar will lead a council of faculty from across campus appointed by the president and provost. They will serve renewable two-to-three-year terms. The council will solicit and evaluate grant proposals, advise on awards, monitor progress and facilitate cross-disciplinary engagement.</p>
<p>Initial letters of inquiry will be due March 14. Invitations to submit full proposals (along with additional instructions on how to prepare the proposals) will be issued by April 2, and full proposals will be due by May 1. Awards will be announced before the end of the spring quarter.</p>
<h2>Grant Criteria</h2>
<p>There will be two types of GDP grants. The main emphasis is on Capacity-Building Research Grants for substantial projects, requiring a minimum of $250,000 and which may take up to 5 years to complete. Recipients will be required to make presentations about their research at an annual, public conference hosted by the GDP initiative.</p>
<p>The GDP also will award smaller Preliminary Research Grants not to exceed $30,000 or more than one year.</p>
<p>Collaborative, multi-faculty proposals are not mandatory but will be strongly encouraged, said Cuéllar. Proposals will be evaluated case-by-case by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substantive focus on global poverty</li>
<li>Potential practical applications</li>
<li>Regional or cross-national impact</li>
<li>Building Stanford's capacity</li>
<li>Scholarly merit</li>
<li>Long-term strategy and budget plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Letters of inquiry for both Capacity-Building Research Grants and Preliminary Research Grants should be submitted <a href=""https://seed.stanford.edu/research/request-proposals"" target=""_blank"">online</a>.</p>

President and Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe, will address graduates during Stanford GSB's ceremony on Saturday, June 15, 2013.",143,"<p>The alumni speaker program was inaugurated in 2010 as a means to inspire graduates in their future careers. ""John has reinvigorated one of Silicon Valley's giants with his strong focus on innovation and customers,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/garth-saloner"">Garth Saloner</a>, Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""He has also united the company behind a shared purpose that technology and commerce can create economic opportunity — a philosophy that is very much in line with our own mission as a school and that of our students.""</p>
<p>Donahoe was appointed president and chief executive officer of eBay Inc. in 2008, after serving as president of the company's eBay Marketplaces business for three years. Since he assumed the company's top spot, eBay has reinvigorated its core marketplace business, aggressively grown its PayPal business, and established leadership in mobile commerce. The company's net revenues and net income both increased approximately 50 percent from 2010 to 2012, and in 2012 alone the company's stock price increased approximately 68 percent (an increase in market capitalization of $27 billion).</p>
<p>As industry analyst Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities noted in a recent <em>Fortune</em> article, Donahoe ""took an underperforming Silicon Valley giant and transformed it into a high-growth, innovative, mobile-focused technology leader.""</p>
<p>Donahoe recognized early that the shift in consumer behavior to mobile was inevitable. In fact, he made several investments in mobile technology even before the first iPhone was released in 2007, and the company now embraces a ""mobile first"" development mentality. Today, the eBay and PayPal apps rank among the top 10 mobile apps within their respective categories in the Apple iTunes and Google Play app stores. In 2013, the company expects eBay and PayPal to each generate more than $20 billion of mobile volume.</p>
<p>Under Donahoe's leadership, eBay has evolved from a company focused on the $500 billion e-commerce market to a global commerce platform company competing in the $10 trillion retail market. Two key moves included the 2011 acquisition of GSI Commerce, which operates websites for major retailers and provides analysis of consumer behavior, and a partnership with Discover that will allow consumers to use PayPal at any one of seven million retail locations that accept Discover card.</p>
<p>Prior to eBay, Donahoe spent more than 20 years at Bain & Company, a worldwide consulting firm based in Boston. Starting as an associate consultant, he rose to become the firm's president and CEO in 1999, overseeing Bain's 30 offices and 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>Donahoe received a BA in economics from Dartmouth College and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He currently serves on the boards of directors for eBay Inc. and Intel Corp. and previously served on the Advisory Council for Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>",,,303071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Donahoe,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/photo-donahoe-john.jpg,eBay Inc.

1,82731,4/9/14 0:00,Stanford Offering Fellowships for African MBA Students,54,news/headlines/stanford-offering-fellowships-african-mba-students,"Applications accepted through June 13, 2014.",44,"<p>Stanford Graduate School of Business is seeking MBA candidates, who are citizens of an African country and interested in contributing to the region's human and economic development, to apply for the <a href=""programs/mba/financial-aid/types/fellowships/stanford-africa-fellowship"">Stanford Africa MBA Fellowship</a>. Fellows must commit to return to Africa within two years, and for at least two years, to leverage their new skills to make an impact on the ground in Africa.</p>
<p>Stanford GSB created the grant, launched in 2013 as a three-year pilot, to enable talented African citizens with a passion for making an impact on the continent's future to pursue an MBA at Stanford. Applications accepted now through June 13, 2014.</p>
<p>Up to eight fellowships will be awarded annually and will cover tuition and associated fees of approximately USD$145,000 for the two-year program. Selected fellows will join the Class of 2017 in September 2015.</p>
<h2>Why Africa?</h2>
<p>Africa is home to many of the world's fastest-growing economies, yet the continent only accounts for a small fraction of global trade. ""There are both great opportunities for economic development as well as management challenges,"" said Stanford Graduate School of Business dean <a href=""/users/saloner"">Garth Saloner</a>, who grew up in South Africa. ""We are committed to supporting the education of promising high-potential leaders who will make a difference in the continent's future. Moreover, African students in our program provide direct insight into an emerging global economy that is increasingly powerful in business.""</p>
<p>The Stanford Africa MBA Fellowship is consistent with Stanford GSB's continuing investment in developing future leaders who understand the implications of Africa's growth. In summer 2013, close to 10% of Stanford MBA students worked in Africa. In 2011, Stanford launched the <a href=""https://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies</a> (SEED) to bridge a critical gap in global efforts to address prosperity around the world. SEED aims to train on-the-ground entrepreneurs to scale their businesses and create jobs. Its first innovation hub was launched in West Africa in 2013, and an East Africa hub is scheduled to open in 2014. The school also supports the Africa Business Club and associated activities, such as the Stanford Africa Forum.</p>
<h2>Fellowship Eligibility</h2>
<p>Prospective fellowship applicants can find details about the new two-stage application process and timeline <a href=""/programs/mba/financial-aid/types/fellowships/stanford-africa-fellowship"">online</a>. In the first stage, applicants complete the free Stanford Africa MBA Fellowship pre-application by June 13, 2014. Up to 50 finalists will be selected by mid-July 2014 based on financial need, as well as Stanford's admission criteria of intellectual vitality, demonstrated leadership potential, and personal qualities and contributions. Finalists then apply for MBA admission to Stanford GSB in Round 1, October 2014.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the fellowship, applicants must be a citizen of an African country. Dual citizens are eligible as long as one citizenship belongs to an African nation. Permanent residents of an African country who are not African citizens are not eligible at this time. Funding is automatically renewed for the second year if the student maintains good academic standing and community citizenship at Stanford GSB. Within two years of graduating from the MBA Program, Stanford Africa MBA Fellows commit to return to Africa for at least two years to leverage their new skills to make an impact on the ground in Africa.</p>

1,42606,7/11/12 0:00,New Faculty Enrich the Stanford GSB Experience,46,news/headlines/new-faculty-2012.html,"Award-winning economist Susan Athey, noted econometrician Guido Imbens, corporate finance expert Joshua Rauh, and others to join Stanford GSB faculty.",150,"<p>Renowned economist Susan Athey, the first female recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal, will be joining the faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) as a professor of economics starting in the 2012-2013 academic year. The GSB faculty will also be bolstered by economics professor Guido Imbens and finance professor Joshua Rauh, as well as 5 assistant professors and 16 new lecturers and visiting faculty.</p>
<p>""We are always seeking new ways to enrich the learning experience for our students, foster a vibrant research community that informs the business world, and provide an environment where academics can grow and thrive in their careers,"" said Stanford GSB Dean Garth Saloner. ""Susan Athey's return to Stanford, along with a roster of highly talented academics and lecturers, will help us continue to fulfill these ambitions.""</p>
<p>Athey, who comes to the GSB from the department of economics at Harvard University, earned her PhD in economics from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1995. After receiving her degree, she taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for six years and Stanford University for five years, moving to Harvard in 2006.</p>
<p>Her current research focuses on the economics of the internet, online advertising and media markets, auctions, and marketplace design. She advises governments and businesses on the design of auction-based markets, and has also served as a consultant to Microsoft since 2007 in the role of chief economist. Athey is the first female recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal, awarded to the American economist under the age of 40 who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge. In 2012, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, one of the highest honors for a U.S. scientist.</p>
<p>Economics professor Guido Imbens also comes to the GSB from Harvard University's department of economics. Imbens' primary field of interest is econometrics, and he has conducted influential research on a broad range of issues throughout the social sciences, greatly improving social scientists' ability to assess the effects of interventions from both field and experimental data. He also works with governments and policy institutions on designing and evaluating economic policy interventions in areas such as education and labor. Imbens received his PhD in economics from Brown University in 1991. He is married to Athey.</p>
<p>Finance professor Joshua Rauh joins the GSB from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. An empirical researcher in corporate finance, Rauh has been influential in evaluating corporate and governmental pensions, using data on pensions to calculate hidden liabilities and inform policy makers and the public. Rauh received his PhD in economics from MIT in 2004. Rauh's most recent work reflects his interest in venture capital and private equity, which further strengthens this programmatic area for the GSB.</p>

1,4296,9/10/08 0:00,Stanford Business School Breaks Ground on New Campus for 21st Century,69,news/headlines/gsb_campus.html,Environmentally Sustainable Campus Will Be Named Knight Management Center.,74,"<p>Stanford GSB formally broke ground on its new business school campus September 10. Designed to fulfill the academic needs of the school's new MBA curriculum and other programs for the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the 360,000-square-foot campus will comprise eight buildings around three quadrangles and will be named the Knight Management Center.</p>
<p>""Leading universities of the 21<sup>st</sup> century need business schools that foster extraordinary intellectual innovation and collaboration,"" said Robert L. Joss, the Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""This new campus provides the physical infrastructure to enable that academic vision to come to life at Stanford.""</p>
<p>Phil Knight Honored During the groundbreaking ceremony, Nike Inc. founder and chairman Philip H. Knight, MBA '62, for whom the new campus is named, pressed his feet—clad, of course, in a pair of black Nike Air Max 360s—into concrete. ""It is fitting that the new campus be named for Phil Knight, who is one of the great innovators and entrepreneurs in American business,"" said Joss. ""He created not just a company but an industry. His generosity, and that of our other alumni, allows the Stanford Graduate School of Business to lead the way and set new standards.""</p>
<p>Knight was an early lead donor with a gift of $105 million — believed to be the largest gift ever to a business school. The campus is expected to cost at least $350 million by completion in 2011. ""My hope is that this new campus will enable future generations of students to have the life-changing experience I had at Stanford Business School,"" said Knight. ""If there was no Stanford Graduate School of Business, there would be no Nike. The idea for a business really never took form until I took that small business management course. It was out of that I had the encouragement and enthusiasm to start Nike.""</p>
<p>The campus will include flexible classroom space and breakout study rooms to accommodate the greater number of smaller classes and programs in the school's new MBA curriculum, launched in 2007. The design aims to invite and engage more students in cross-disciplinary experiences involving Stanford University's six other schools of engineering, law, education, earth sciences, medicine, and humanities and sciences. The campus will include a 600-seat lecture hall, dining facilities, a parking structure for 900 vehicles, and dedicated space for career management and executive education programs. It also will offer classrooms for collaborative hands-on learning or virtual communication linking students from other schools at Stanford or around the globe, as well as faculty and staff offices.</p>
<p>""The new campus is going to be sensational,"" said Knight. ""I appreciated the scope of the whole thing as I watched them tear down the site today."" Leading in Environmental Sustainability The construction of the Knight Management Center campus leverages Stanford President John L. Hennessy's call for the university to be a force for change on issues of global importance, especially regarding the environment.</p>
<p>""One of the biggest global challenges facing us today is the sustainable use of our planet's natural resources,"" said Hennessy. ""The Graduate School of Business will play a key role in helping us address these challenges by leading the way in its sustainable development of this new campus. And in the long term, it is the creation of economic incentives and alignments between business and society that will have the greatest impact in addressing our environmental challenges. I have no doubt that this new campus and the Business School's new MBA curriculum will enrich the learning of future generations of students who will lead the way in problem solving.""</p>
<p>Built to demonstrate maximum leadership in environmental sustainability, the new campus architecture will blend indoor and outdoor spaces, and utilize solar technology to reduce energy needs. The project aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce overall water usage by at least 30 percent.</li>
<li>Exceed current energy efficiency standards by at least 40 percent.</li>
<li>Recycle or salvage 50 to 75 percent of non-hazardous construction debris.</li>
<li>Use rainwater or re-circulated gray water to reduce potable water use for building sewage conveyance by 80 percent.</li>
<li>Use low- or non-volatile organic compound—emitting materials to ensure exceptional indoor air quality.</li>
<li>Satisfy not only the University's Guidelines for Sustainable Building, but seek Platinum Certification, the highest level in the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED rating certification system.</li>
</ul>
<p>""Living smart means that the building has a social responsibility that can manifest itself in a concern for the future in terms of the resources that are used and the resources that are consumed by the building,"" said Principal Architect Stan Boles of BOORA Architects, the Portland, Ore.-based executive architect on the project. ""For example, the orientation of the buildings is narrow in the north-south dimension,"" said Boles. ""They are designed for optimum daylighting, ventilation, and for shading of one another. The exterior walls are designed so that areas of glass are created but shaded by exterior screens to prevent excessive heat gain.""</p>
<h2>Building for a New Curriculum</h2>
<p>The business school's new curriculum, introduced in fall 2007, is highly personalized, with more global content and expanded leadership development and student advising. For example, all entering students enroll in a 16-person Critical Analytical Thinking seminar through which they learn to analyze, present and defend a point of view. In the leadership program that is part of a new Strategic Leadership course, students are divided into squads of eight for leadership simulations during which they are videotaped and receive personal coaching and feedback.</p>
<p>Stanford's small MBA student-body of 750 students, less than half that of other top business schools, and its collaborative culture, makes the high-touch program possible. Architecture The Knight Management Center comprises a series of small buildings situated around ""outdoor rooms""— Town Square, Faculty Courtyard, Community Court, Amphitheater, and Academic Walk — which will provide numerous opportunities for teams to collaborate and work. The central Town Square has been designed as a gathering place for students, faculty, and staff — an outdoor workspace or place for community events and leisure.</p>
<p>""A key element of the business school is the very intimate relationship between student and faculty, the small class size,"" said Boles. ""A lot of emphasis was placed on individuals collaborating with one another, and with their faculty. So, the sense of place will reinforce that small-scale feeling, almost like a village where people are working and studying, and having a sense of community within."" It will incorporate Stanford's traditional architecture with a contemporary approach.</p>
<p>The Serra Street façade will display Stanford features such as red tile roofs and recessed windows. Welcoming pathways will be incorporated into the campus design to create architectural interest as well as encourage interaction among Stanford faculty and students. Tiered classrooms will have aisles for flexibility, and large windows will allow energy-saving natural light to penetrate.</p>
<p>The Knight campus, now under construction along Serra Street across from the business school's Schwab Residential Center, will complement the Schwab complex, which was built in 1997 to house MBA students and Executive Education participants. The Knight Management Center will comprise about 100,000 more square feet than the current campus. Business School buildings now in use will be returned to the University for other uses.</p>
<p>BOORA Architects is involved in a number of Stanford University projects including the environmentally sustainable Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy Building that opened in 2008. Architectural firms William Rawn Associates and Bohlin Cywinski Jackson also contributed to early stage planning and design. Turner Construction, a leading construction firm for higher education and green construction in the United States, is building the campus.</p>
<p>The campus, funded by major gifts and donations in addition to the Knight gift, is expected to open in 2010 and be completed by spring 2011. ""To raise so much capital for such a magnificent project is strong testimony to the enthusiasm and innovative spirit of the alumni of the Stanford Graduate School of Business,"" said Stanford University Provost John Etchemendy, who opened the groundbreaking ceremony. Stanford University Trustee and Keystone Inc. President Robert M. Bass, MBA '74, who served as chair of the Ad Hoc Committee for Graduate School of Business Campus Planning, and Stanford Architect David Lenox have been essential to the project and also presided at the groundbreaking.</p>",,,302296,,,4345,Our Campus,stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus,,,,,,,,,,,Joss & Knight,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/Phil-Knight-Stanford-GSB1_199x214.jpg,"Dean Robert Joss (left) and Provost John Etchemendy (right), give Phil Knight, MBA '62, a hand putting his shoe print into concrete",,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,Monument to Change with green and blue flip digits,,,,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell,,a
1,8766,3/15/12 0:00,Knight Management Center Awarded LEED Platinum Rating  ,55,news/headlines/leed.html,The eight-building complex designed to support an innovative MBA curriculum achieved a LEED Platinum rating for environmental sustainability.,141,"<p>The <a href=""http://www.usgbc.org/"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Green Building Council</a> has certified the <a href=""/stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus/environmental-leadership"">Knight Management Center</a> at the Stanford Graduate School of Business as LEED Platinum<sup>®</sup>, the highest rating for environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>The Knight Management Center opened in April 2011 as a new home for the school's innovative MBA curriculum and other programs, and as a physical space intended to both bring students together from across Stanford University's seven schools for interdisciplinary learning and demonstrate the Graduate School of Business' commitment to environmental leadership. ""As we train new generations of managerial leaders, we hope that Stanford's commitment to sustainability will inspire our students to promote sustainable business practices in the future,"" said Garth Saloner, dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>Filled with natural light and the latest technology, the 360,000-square-foot facility underscores what is taught in many of the school's electives such as <em>Environmental Entrepreneurship</em> and <em>Environmental Science for Managers and Policy Makers</em>, as well as in core classes covering sustainability across the functions of business, and in its MBA/MS Environment and Resources joint-degree program.</p>
<p>During the accreditation process, the Knight Management Center received 60 points, more than the minimum 52 points required for the LEED Platinum version 2.2 rating. Green aspects of the building that contribute to its high sustainability rating include building and landscape design and optimized energy and water use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The relatively narrow dimensions of the classroom buildings and floor-to-ceiling glass maximize the amount of daylight entering the building, significantly reducing the need for electric lighting; 90% of interior work spaces are illuminated by daylight and room lights turn off automatically when a room is emptied, reducing the electricity load.</li>
<li>Photovoltaic panels on the roof harvest enough solar energy to power 12.5% of the complex's annual energy demand. The Knight Management Center's eight buildings exceed current state energy standards by 45%. For example, more efficient under-floor air distribution systems replace forced air systems, and air-handling units recapture waste heat and redistribute it where it is needed. During summer months, the building employs night flushing systems, as well as automated skylights and windows, to release the hot air of day and draw in cool air overnight.</li>
<li>The center has reduced potable water usage for sewer conveyance by 80% by using grey water and rainwater.</li>
<li>Fifty percent of the site is devoted to open space, and parking for 900 cars is underground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Built across the street from the beautiful Schwab Residential Center for MBA students and executive education participants, the Knight Center design fosters an integrated living and learning environment. Indoor and outdoor spaces seamlessly blend with walls that fold open to the outside for increased interaction in social areas including the circular Arbuckle Dining Pavilion.</p>
<h2>Stanford's Sustainable Master Plan Legacy</h2>
<p>Frederick Law Olmsted's master plan for Stanford University, developed in the late 1800s, set the Main Quad as the dominant feature of the campus. For the 21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond, Stanford has embarked on a mission to build on and restore the original master plan by reinforcing Serra Street as the primary east/west axis for the campus. Placing the Graduate School of Business at the east end of Serra Street, with the School of Medicine at the west end, strengthens the importance of Serra Street as the primary campus link.</p>
<p>The east/west axis is also the ideal orientation for sustainable building design. The Knight Management Center takes advantage of the southern exposure to reduce the need for artificial lighting, while the long north orientation allows the buildings to take advantage of the Mediterranean climate through the use of operable windows providing natural ventilation to many interior spaces.</p>",,,303071,,,,Our Campus,stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus,,,,,,,,,,,KMC,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/news-page-resize-leed.jpg,Photovoltaic panels harvest enough solar energy to power 12.5% of the complex's annual energy demand.,Aerial view of Knight Management Center buildings,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,Monument to Change with green and blue flip digits,,,Energy ,,,,,,,,,Barbara Buell,,a
1,82666,3/26/14 0:00,Nike Cofounder Phil Knight to Deliver 2014 Graduation Address,61,news/headlines/nike-cofounder-chairman-phil-knight-deliver-2014-graduation-address,Distinguished GSB alum will share his experiences at the iconic company with graduating students as they embark on new career paths.,132,"<p>Nike Cofounder and Chairman Phil Knight, who graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1962 and subsequently transformed an entire industry, will address Stanford GSB students during their 2014 graduation ceremony on Saturday, June 14.</p>
<p>Stanford GSB's alumni speaker program was inaugurated in 2010 as a means to inspire graduates in their future careers. ""Phil's unique ability to see opportunity where others did not, along with his perseverance and willingness to take risks, enabled him to transform an entire industry,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/garth-saloner"">Garth Saloner</a>, Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean of Stanford GSB. ""Our students seek to follow his example as a change agent after graduation — and Phil has actively supported their ambitions through his ongoing engagement with the school.""</p>
<p>Knight currently serves as chairman of the board of directors of Nike, which he cofounded with track and field coach Bill Bowerman in 1964. Knight originally developed the business plan for the company during an entrepreneurship course he took while in business school.</p>
<p>During a 2009 interview, he said that it was ""almost certainly true that if there was no Stanford Graduate School of Business, there would be no Nike."" He also observed that ""it was out of [that entrepreneurship course] that I really had the courage and the enthusiasm to start this company that ultimately became Nike.""</p>
<p>After selling running shoes at track events from the back of his car and making sales of $8,000 in the company's first year, he eventually built Nike into one of the world's largest suppliers of athletic shoes, apparel, and equipment. He served as its president for 25 years.</p>
<p>In 2006, Knight contributed $105 million to help establish Stanford GSB's new eight-building complex on the Stanford University campus. Named the <a href=""/stanford-gsb-experience/life-stanford-gsb/campus"">Knight Management Center</a> in his honor, the LEED-certified complex provides an environment that fosters collaboration both within Stanford GSB and with the rest of the larger university.</p>
<p>""Stanford meant a lot to me, and it's really my hope other students who come to Stanford have as transformative an experience as I did,"" said Knight at the time of the center's groundbreaking.</p>

1,81806,11/5/13 0:00,Solar Industry Execs Predict Consolidation Creates Winners/Losers ,66,news/headlines/stanford-dialogue-solar-industry-executives-predict-consolidation-will-create-new-winners-losers,"Report from Stanford Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance outlines four scenarios for industry ""glocalization.""",125,"<p>Top solar-industry leaders believe their sector, now in flux, is likely to consolidate around a handful of global companies, and that which countries win and lose will depend on how the consolidation plays out, according to a report from Stanford University's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/steyer-taylor-center-for-energy-policy-and-finance"">Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance</a>.</p>
<p>The report, ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.law.stanford.edu/publications/avoiding-sunstroke"">Avoiding Sunstroke: Assessing National Competitiveness in the Global Solar Race</a>,"" reflects the conclusions of some 20 top executives of solar companies from five countries who met at Stanford for an unusual day-long scenario-planning exercise to try to answer a crucial question about the small but rapidly growing solar industry: What will it look like in 2025? Which sorts of companies, and which countries, will do what?</p>
<p>The report, detailing the views of the executives who attended, says the global solar industry is likely to develop based on a pattern of ""glocalization"": A handful of global companies will dominate the industry, and they will locate different parts of their businesses in different countries based on their sense of where they can make the most money. That conclusion belies a claim, heard often in industry and policy circles, that China has ""won"" the solar industry and that other countries — the U.S., Germany, and others — have ""lost"" it. But this ""glocal"" view of the solar industry's growth suggests that many markets around the world have critical — and potentially profitable — roles to play as solar technologies and markets evolve.</p>
<p>This report, like the workshop on which it's based, is qualitative rather than quantitative. It does not endorse the views of those at the workshop. It is intended to provide a snapshot of what one influential and representative slice of the global solar industry thinks about the industry's future. Each of the scenarios it explores is a plausible future.</p>
<p>The workshop was organized by Stanford's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, a joint initiative of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.law.stanford.edu/"">Stanford Law School</a> and Stanford Graduate School of Business, and the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bmu.de/en/"">German Federal Ministry for the Environment</a>. Jeffrey Ball, scholar-in-residence at the Steyer-Taylor Center, and Jonas Meckling, senior adviser at the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, wrote the report.</p>
<p>Top executives from solar companies based in China, Germany, Italy, Korea and the U.S. participated in the workshop. They lead companies that produce polysilicon, solar panels, inverters and other components; that lease solar systems to consumers; that finance solar installations; and more. PwC U.S. helped structure and moderate the workshop's scenario-planning sessions.</p>
<p>The executives at the workshop charted how the industry might develop in four scenarios that revolve around two key factors: the level of penetration of solar energy in overall power markets, and the extent to which national solar markets are open or closed to foreign-based companies and to the integration of solar power into the national energy mix.</p>
<h2>A Snapshot of Four Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Global Sun</h3>
<p>Solar power generates more than 8% of global electricity, roughly 25 times the current level, and national barriers to its expansion are low. Major oil, power, chemical and electronics companies enter the industry. China and Korea dominate in solar manufacturing. The U.S. and Germany dominate in technological innovation.</p>
<h3>Solar Systems</h3>
<p>Solar produces more than 8% of global electricity, but countries impose protectionist measures that make costs higher than they otherwise might be. China is triumphant, tapping its big domestic solar market. In the U.S., the military is a major solar player.</p>
<h3>Sunblock</h3>
<p>Solar generates less than 1% of global electricity, and barriers in many nations break it up into a patchwork of limited local markets. One impediment: Utilities in many countries enact policies that many consumers perceive as raising solar energy's costs.</p>
<h3>Total Eclipse</h3>
<p>Solar is utterly insignificant. It produces less than 1% of global power; countries don't care enough about it even to impose barriers to try to grab its spoils. Solar grows only in markets with severely underdeveloped conventional electricity systems. Among them: many African countries, and India.</p>
<p>The ""glocal"" view of the solar industry detailed in the report suggests several takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solar manufacturing is likely to concentrate among a handful of global companies. They might be based in China or other Asian markets; they might be based in Europe or the U.S.</li>
<li>Regardless of where these companies are headquartered, they're likely to do much of their manufacturing in Asia. They're likely to do the final manufacturing step – assembling their actual solar modules – in end markets where domestic solar demand is large enough to justify an assembly plant.</li>
<li>Several wild cards could change the calculus about where in the world it's most profitable for a global solar manufacturer to manufacture: regional differences in energy prices, raw-material costs and wages; global transportation costs; and technological advances that reduce the need for factory-floor labor or that radically change the kind of photovoltaic device that the market wants.</li>
<li>Manufacturing is only one piece of the solar business. Other pieces – research and development, manufacturing of tooling, commercialization of new technologies, financing, marketing, and the installation and maintenance of solar projects – offer broad opportunities for countries to play to their comparative strengths.</li>
</ul>

1,4172,10/14/08 0:00,Three Business School Students Killed in Car Crash,50,news/headlines/carcrash_1008.html,"Viet Nguyen, 28, of Raleigh, N.C.; Chris Sahm, 29, of Long Island, N.Y.; and Micah Springer, 23, of Columbus, Ohio, died Oct. 10 near Big Sur, Calif.",149,"<p> Three MBA students from the Business School died Oct. 10 when the car in which they were riding apparently careened down a cliff off Highway 1 near Big Sur, Calif. The three killed were Viet Nguyen, 28, of Raleigh, N.C.; Chris Sahm, 29, of Long Island, N.Y.; and Micah Springer, 23, of Columbus, Ohio. They were reported missing the evening of Oct. 10 after failing to meet a group of fellow graduate students for a weekend gathering in Big Sur.</p>
<p>Classmates, who had arrived earlier at the retreat center and became worried, had notified authorities that there was debris on Highway 1 a few hundred yards from the turnoff to the center. On Saturday morning classmates found personal items belonging to the trio scattered down the hill from the highway. They signaled to a California Highway Patrol helicopter that had been dispatched to search and the car was spotted at the bottom of a cliff that dropped from 400 to 700 feet below the highway. The cause of the accident is under investigation.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, hundreds of classmates wearing red and white ribbons streamed in a long procession from the Schwab Residential Center, where Nguyen and Springer had lived, to the Business School a few blocks away for a memorial service. The trio were eulogized by classmates, relatives, Business School faculty, and staff with stories about their intelligence, humor, and humanity.</p>
<p>On Saturday as news of the deaths spread an impromptu gathering was held at the Schwab Residential Center that houses many first-year students. ""There is no way to absorb the shock, the tragedy, the unfairness of these deaths,"" Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann of the Stanford Religious Life office told the group. ""Being part of a community provides a small modicum of solace at a time when there are no words. Our hope in gathering is that we can feel one another's love, feel one another's concern. This loss is harder than any other experience."" ""This is a tragic loss for the Stanford community of three brilliant and promising students who had so much to contribute to the world, and lost their lives too suddenly and too soon,"" said Stanford University President John Hennessy. ""To the families, friends, and graduate business colleagues of Viet, Chris, and Micah, and all those who are also grieving at this shocking news, we send our deepest sympathies from the entire university community."" Business School Dean Robert L. Joss said that the School's close-knit community was stunned and saddened at the loss of all three students. ""All of us are shocked and full of grief, and our hearts and prayers go out to their families and friends,"" Joss wrote in a note to students and faculty. ""We will prepare plans for the coming week to remember them, to share our grief, and to support each other at such a difficult time."" Nguyen and Springer were first-year MBA students who had started classes in late September. Springer also was pursuing a PhD in materials science and engineering. Sahm was in his second year of the MBA program. Nguyen was first in his family to attend college. He earned undergraduate degrees at Duke University in political science and French and an MA in French from Columbia University. Before business school, he had a career in marketing watches and jewelry, working as a brand manager for Chanel and earlier as a product correspondent for Louis Vuitton and as a marketer for Baume Mercier. Sahm earned his undergraduate degree in sociology at Harvard College. He worked in strategic planning at American Express in New York City and in Sao Paolo, Brazil. He then spent two years as a financial manager at Saks Fifth Avenue where he launched Saks' co-branded credit card (with HBSC). He also volunteered as a mentor to troubled youth. Springer earned his undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering at Ohio State University where he graduated at the top of his class. He had completed a year of his PhD in materials science engineering last year with a focus on nanomaterials for biomedical applications. He was combining that with his MBA to bridge the disconnect between scientific technology and the ""real world."" Springer previously interned in the nanomaterials group at NASA. He survived a cancer diagnosis that gave him a life expectancy to the age of six. Friends said in his PhD work he was researching novel cancer eradication techniques and felt strongly that they could apply to cancer cures.</p>",,,302296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nguyen,http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/news/images/viet.jpg,Viet Nguyen,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,,,,,,MBA,,,,,Helen Chang,,a

<p>An assistant professor of accounting, Ogneva taught the financial accounting class for 57 Sloan fellows. ""The Sloan Program was new to you but you probably had heard that the students were older and more opinionated,"" said Sloan Fellow Lakshmi Lakshmanan in introducing the award winner to her classmates during an afternoon celebration.</p>
<p>""We appreciated that you cared about our learning and worried about us when you thought we weren't keeping up."" Ogneva's concern extended to arranging for several help sessions, including teaching one herself the Sunday afternoon before the final exam. Students also praised her for soliciting feedback and constantly fine tuning her teaching to meet student needs.</p>
<p>""This class would not have been a success without you,"" Ogneva told the fellows. ""I expected a group that was motivated, intelligent, and successful in their careers. I did not expect a group that was so genuine, so sincerely friendly and open to me.""</p>
<p>The Stanford Sloan Program is a 10.5-month fulltime degree program for experienced managers with a minimum of eight years of experience.</p>

The deadline for applications is June 10, 2014.</p>
<p>Meeting throughout extended weekends beginning on September 25, 2014, the Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique program will provide exposure to both the fundamentals of business and the practical aspects of identifying, evaluating, and moving business ideas forward. It is designed to deliver the same kind of immersive, innovative, and hands-on instruction that working professionals and graduate students at Stanford experience — in a European dimension. The course content will teach innovators how to formulate, develop, and commercialize their ideas.</p>
<p>Those interested in learning more can join an online information session on Monday, May 5, at 7pm CEST (10am PDT). Stanford Ignite faculty director <a href=""/users/yossi"">Yossi Feinberg</a> will touch on core elements of entrepreneurship and provide a taste of what to expect from the program. Registration for this free webinar is available <a href=""/events/stanford-ignite-polytechnique-informational-webinar"">online</a>.</p>
<p>Participants in last year's inaugural program in Paris describe the experience as transformational.</p>
<p>""Three exceptional months of hard work on my project in the framework of the Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique program propelled it to become one of the winners of the World Innovation Challenge,"" said Franz Bozsak, a PhD alum of École Polytechnique in biomedical engineering and a 'Stanford Igniter' from last year's inaugural Paris program. His project, ""Instent,"" is developing a novel cardiac stent that will enable physicians to remotely monitor patients and tailor post-operative treatment to the needs of the patient. ""It was the interaction with the people in the Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique program — my team members, the other participants, the professors, and my mentors — that had the most significant transformational impact on my project.""</p>
<p>Noam Ben Haim, a senior product manager at Google-Zurich, similarly credits the work in his team for a breakthrough experience. ""Within a very short time, our small group had to learn how to work with each other, understand the real problem we are trying to solve, research it, and build a business plan worthy of VC attention,"" he said. The computer science and cognitive sciences graduate of Hebrew University was a team member on a project aimed at solving the financing gap among African entrepreneurs, giving small-scale investors access to growth opportunities in Africa. ""I am already applying the business concepts and skills I learned from Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique to my current job,"" he said.</p>
<p>Stanford Ignite draws on the same world-class Stanford Graduate School of Business faculty who teach in the MBA program. ""This program is appropriate for individuals who wish to bring innovation and entrepreneurial thinking to their current role, and for those who are planning to start a new venture,"" said Yossi Feinberg, a professor of economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business, who directs the Stanford Ignite program. ""It provides graduate students, innovators, scientists, and engineers from leading companies the essential toolset for creating impactful ventures.""</p>
<p>""Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique offers the best of both worlds,"" said Bruno Martinaud, director of the Technology Venture, and Polytechnique academic lead for the Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique program. ""Combining one of the top programs offered by Stanford Graduate School of Business with key aspects of the European entrepreneurial environment, through lectures, coaching, guest speakers, and exposure, this unique, condensed program is designed to bring a life-changing experience to the participants.""</p>
<p>Intended for individuals who do not have graduate business training, Stanford Ignite—Polytechnique applicants must be currently enrolled students in a master's, PhD, MD, or post-doctoral program studying non-business fields; or must be professionals with a minimum of a bachelor's (BA or BS) degree from a regionally accredited institution. Advanced degrees preferred. Classes meet Thursday evenings, Fridays, and Saturdays, and additional meetings, as needed, for project work.</p>
<p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit all materials as soon as possible. A complete application will contain: the finished online application, a resume, a series of short essays, and two letters of recommendation. Tuition is USD$10,000 and includes course materials, some meals, and program events.</p>
<p>""Stanford Ignite participants have started over 100 successful companies since the program was introduced at Stanford in 2006,"" said Bethany Coates, assistant dean, Stanford Global Innovation Programs. ""The Paris Stanford Igniters will join a global network of high-impact innovators and entrepreneurs.""</p>
<p>Jacques Biot, president of École Polytechnique, said, ""Building on the success of last year's program, I'm delighted by this wonderful, exclusive cooperation, which brings the best of both our institutions to the benefit of participants. This new edition will again enable entrepreneurs to refine their business plans, boost innovation, and foster brilliant startups.""</p>

1,82596,3/13/14 0:00,New Residence Hall Will House Nearly All First-Year MBAs by 2016,64,news/headlines/new-residential-building-will-house-nearly-all-first-year-stanford-gsb-students-2016,$75 million project enhances Knight Management Center living and learning complex.,82,"<p><em>Updated Friday, June 13, 2014.</em></p>
<p>Stanford GSB will build additional residential units to create an expanded living and learning environment adjacent to its state-of-the-art <a href=""/visit/closer-look-campus"">Knight Management Center</a>. The four-story structure will allow the school to offer nearly all first-year MBA students a place to live on campus for the first time.</p>
<p>Stanford plans to break ground on the 146,000-square-foot facility in fall 2014. The construction will adjoin the existing 158,000-square-foot <a href=""/programs/mba/student-life/housing"">Schwab Residential Center</a> on Serra Street. The new building will add 200 new single-living units to the existing 280 units at Schwab, providing enough capacity to accommodate the approximately 400 MBAs who enter the school annually. It will also house up to 80 visiting executive education participants. Escondido Village and Munger will continue to provide housing for couples and first-year MBA students with children.</p>
<p>""This new residential space allows us to offer a genuinely immersive experience to all of our incoming students and complete the vision for the Knight Management Center — a place where business school students can live, learn, collaborate, and connect with each other and with students from across Stanford's other six schools,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/garth-saloner"">Garth Saloner</a>, dean of Stanford GSB. The Knight Management Center, which opened in 2011, already includes a Town Square, café, public meeting spaces, library, classrooms and study rooms, conference center, auditorium, and Arbuckle Dining Pavilion. And the Schwab Residential Center remains one of the most dramatic residences on campus with its brightly colored courtyards and Mexican architecture.</p>
<p>The $75 million project will be funded by philanthropic gifts, operating revenues, and debt.</p>
<p>Legorreta + Legorreta and Steinberg Architects, the architectural firms who teamed up to design the beautiful Schwab Residential Center, are engaged to design the new residence. The 200 new units will have private entrances and baths, as well as a shared kitchen. The units will be similar to the rooms in the Schwab Residential Center, but slightly larger and will feature several enhancements.</p>
<p>The addition also will include construction of a large 2,900-square-foot multipurpose room, which will be available for university use. The common area spaces within the residence will be available to Stanford GSB students.</p>
<p><a href=""http://lbre.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Land, Buildings and Real Estate</a>, along with Stanford GSB, are pursuing sustainability opportunities as well as life-cycle cost analyses in the design and delivery of an inspiring and environmentally friendly project.</p>
<p>Site demolition was completed in March 2013. Design concepts were approved by the Stanford Board of Trustees in June 2014.</p>

1,82206,2/3/14 0:00,Online Course Advances Awareness of Retirement Planning and Pensions,68,news/headlines/online-course-advances-understanding-retirement-planning-pension-policy,Massive open online course led by Finance Professor Joshua Rauh extends the reach of Stanford Graduate School of Business.,122,"<p>The first massive open online course (MOOC) created and run by Stanford Graduate School of Business — called <a href=""http://online.stanford.edu/course/rauh-finance"" target=""_blank"">The Finance of Retirement and Pensions</a> — concluded on January 24, 2014, with a live symposium on the Stanford campus featuring top-performing teams from the course's final project.</p>
<p>This concluding event was just one of the unique aspects of the course, which sought to educate the general public about the fundamental financial principles that underpin sound retirement planning, as well as illuminate the looming crisis in public pensions.</p>
<p>The course was led by Stanford Graduate School of Business Finance Professor <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/joshua-d-rauh"">Joshua Rauh</a>, one of the nation's leading experts on the subject of public finance. ""Professor Rauh has changed the national debate about the impending pension crisis,"" observed Stanford faculty member <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/peter-m-demarzo"">Peter DeMarzo</a>, who also serves as faculty director of educational technology at Stanford GSB, during the closing symposium event.</p>
<p>The course was part of the school's broader initiative to explore the most productive ways to use educational technology, including ways to reach beyond Stanford GSB's physical campus. As Rauh remarked during the concluding event, ""We achieved our goal to reach people who are planning their own retirement and inform them about public policy surrounding this issue, particularly the ways in which public pension problems are threatening to eat away at vital public services, and the corresponding impact on taxpayers.""</p>
<p>The 8-week course, which attracted more than 44,000 registrants, featured 73 separate video lectures that were viewed over 225,000 times. Each video was viewed 3,000 to 5,000 times, representing a 100-times increase in reach over on-campus courses, observed DeMarzo at the symposium. Meanwhile, Rauh's live webcasts with retirement and pension experts were viewed more than 9,000 times.</p>
<p>The course revealed a marked improvement in understanding about the financial concepts related to retirement planning, as demonstrated by surveys taken at the middle and end of the course. By the end of the course, an overwhelming majority of survey respondents felt better prepared for retirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>89% agreed that they knew how much to save in order to retire at their desired age (up from 74% at the midpoint of the course)</li>
<li>84% agreed that they had a sound strategy on how to spend money during retirement (up from 59%)</li>
<li>86% agreed that they had a sound strategy for allocating assets (up from 59%)</li>
<li>93% agreed that they felt more confident that they would have enough saved to live comfortably during retirement (up from 82%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more dramatic was the shift in understanding relative to the state of public pensions. Early in the course, only 41% of respondents agreed that they had a solid understanding of how U.S. pension systems work and how they are funded. By the end of the course, that number had reached 93%.</p>
<p>As one participant commented in an online discussion forum: ""[This course] helped me think about my retirement in a new way and also made me a little aware of some aspects of public pensions — I certainly wouldn't have considered that without this class. I particularly liked the technical analysis in the lectures combined with the pragmatic experience shared by participants in the forums.""</p>
<p>Based on survey data, the majority of active participants in the course were over 50 years of age, held a post-graduate degree, and either were employed full-time or retired. For those who were not already retired, 47% intended to retire in the next 10 years. Fifty-five percent of participants were from the United States.</p>
<p>Of all survey respondents, only 32% had a defined benefit pension plan through their employer, while 67% had a 401(k) or other type of employer defined contribution plan. In addition to these plans, respondents indicated that they are preparing for their retirement by investing in IRAs or other individual retirement savings accounts (76%). The majority of respondents invest in equity mutual funds or exchange traded funds (76%), fixed income mutual funds or exchange traded funds (55%), and individual stocks (51%), among other asset classes.</p>

The grant was created to encourage talented African citizens with a commitment to the continent's development to pursue an MBA at Stanford.</p>
<p>Up to eight fellowships will be awarded annually. Each will cover tuition and associated fees of approximately US$140,000 for the two-year program. The fellowship has been launched as a pilot and is expected to continue for three to five years.</p>
<p>Africa is home to 6 of the world's 10 fastest-growing economies. The continent offers the highest level of return on foreign direct investment in the world. At the same time, Africa accounts for just 2% of global trade. ""There are both great opportunities for economic development as well as management challenges,"" said Stanford Graduate School of Business dean Garth Saloner, who grew up in South Africa. ""We are committed to supporting the education of promising high-potential leaders who will make a difference in the continent's future. Moreover, African students in our program provide direct insight into an emerging global economy that is increasingly powerful in business.""</p>
<p>In addition, the Stanford Africa MBA Fellowship is consistent with Stanford GSB's continuing investment in developing future leaders who understand the implications of Africa's growth. In summer 2012, 10% of Stanford MBA students worked in Africa. In 2011, Stanford launched the <a href=""http://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies</a> (SEED) with a $150 million gift. SEED aims to train on-the-ground entrepreneurs to scale their businesses and create jobs. Its first innovation hub will be introduced in West Africa in 2013. The school also supports an annual Africa Forum and Africa Business Club at Stanford.</p>
<h2>Fellowship Eligibility</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the fellowship, students must be a citizen of an African country. Dual citizens are eligible as long as one citizenship belongs to an African nation. Permanent residents of an African country are not eligible. All fellowship applicants must first be admitted to the Stanford MBA Program through the same process as other applicants. All applicants will be assessed on Stanford's admission criteria of intellectual vitality, demonstrated leadership potential, and personal qualities and contributions. Stanford Africa MBA Fellows must return to work in Africa within two years of completing the MBA and work for a period of at least two years there.

1,83236,6/18/14 0:00,$4.6 Million Awarded for Research to Help Alleviate Poverty,59,news/headlines/stanford-global-development-poverty-initiative-awards-million-research-aimed-alleviating-poverty,Global Development and Poverty Initiative money builds on 22 awards funded by Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies.,136,"<p>Fourteen Stanford researchers addressing global poverty through a range of academic disciplines are receiving a total of $4.6 million in awards from the university-wide <a href=""http://fsi.stanford.edu/news/stanford_launches_universitywide_global_development_and_poverty_research_initiative_20140220/"" target=""_blank"">Global Development and Poverty (GDP) initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Their projects, which are the first to be funded by the GDP, deal with challenges of health, violence, economics, governance and education in the developing world.</p>
<p>""GDP seeks to transform scholarly activity and dialogue at Stanford around the topic of global poverty, so that the university may have a greater impact on poverty alleviation in developing economies,"" said GDP faculty co-chair Jesper B. Sørensen. ""By focusing on placing a small number of big bets, GDP encourages researchers to think big, and to move beyond the conventional way of doing things. We are thrilled by the inaugural set of awardees, as they demonstrate the creative, inter-disciplinary approaches that will make Stanford a leader in this area.""</p>
<p>The GDP initiative is part of the <a href=""https://seed.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies</a> (SEED) and is administered in partnership with Stanford's <a href=""http://fsi.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies</a> (FSI). The GDP is co-chaired by Sørensen, the faculty director for SEED and the Robert A. and Elizabeth R. Jeffe Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business; and Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, senior fellow and director of FSI and the Stanley Morrison Professor at Stanford Law School.</p>
<p>SEED, which seeks to alleviate poverty by stimulating the creation of economic opportunities through innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of businesses, was established in 2011 through a generous gift from Robert King, MBA '60, and his wife, Dorothy.</p>
<p>Through complementary areas of focus, GDP funding and other SEED research initiatives will stimulate research, novel interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions to problems of global poverty and development. GDP research aims to pursue answers to crucial questions that are essential to an understanding of how to reduce global poverty and promote economic development. That includes governance and the rule of law, education, health, and food security – all of which are essential for entrepreneurship to thrive. By contrast, other SEED research focuses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of businesses in developing economies.</p>
<p>Since 2012, SEED's Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Developing Economies Award program also has doled out 22 awards and seven PhD fellowships to help support and scale businesses in developing economies. Among the $1 million in funded projects were studies of how to improve the livelihoods of small-holder cacao farmers throughout the tropics; how to identify startups with high job- and wealth-creating potential in Chile; how political accountability affects the ability to attract investment in Sierra Leone; and how managerial practices affect trade entrepreneurship in China.</p>
<h2>First GDP Awards</h2>
<p>The first 14 GDP award recipients are professors of economics, political science, law, medicine, pediatrics, education and biology, and senior fellows from FSI, the Woods Institute, and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR).</p>
<p>""Each of these projects cuts across disciplines, reflects innovative thinking, and has the potential to generate crucial knowledge about how to improve the lives of the poor around the world,"" Cuéllar said. ""These projects, along with a variety of workshops engaging the university and external stakeholders, will help us strengthen Stanford's long-term capacity to address issues of global poverty through research, education and outreach.""</p>
<p>Among the award recipients is <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~pdupas/"" target=""_blank"">Pascaline Dupas</a>, an associate professor of economics and senior fellow at SIEPR. Dupas, along with faculty from the Center for Health Policy and Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law, will launch the Stanford Economic Development Research Initiative using GDP funds. This initiative will focus on collecting high-quality institutional and individual-level data on economic activity in a number of developing countries over the long term, and making these data available to scholars around the world.</p>
<p><a href=""http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/beatriz_magaloni/"" target=""_blank"">Beatriz Magaloni</a>, an associate professor of political science and senior fellow at FSI, is receiving an award to lead a team focused on criminal violence and its effects on the poor in developing economies, and the practical solutions for increasing security in those regions.</p>
<p><a href=""http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/people/douglas_k_owens/"" target=""_blank"">Douglas K. Owens</a>, a professor of medicine and FSI senior fellow, was awarded an award to help him lead a team that will develop models to estimate how alternative resource allocations for health interventions among the poor will influence health and economic outcomes.</p>
<p><a href=""https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/faculty/stephen-haber"" target=""_blank"">Stephen Haber</a>, a professor of political science and history and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, received an award to bring together Stanford researchers interested in examining the long-term institutional constraints on economic development. Their goal will be to provide policymakers with a framework for determining the conditions under which particular innovations are likely to have positive payoffs, and the conditions under which resources will likely be wasted.</p>
<p>Other projects will address the educational impacts of solar lighting systems in poor communities; identifying interventions to improve the profits and safety among poor, smallholder pig farmers in Bangladesh and China; the role of law and institutions in economic development and poverty reduction; and how to rethink worldwide refugee problems. Awards are also being provided to researchers focused on microfinance, online education and teacher training.</p>
<p>The project proposals were reviewed by an interdisciplinary faculty advisory council chaired by Cuéllar and Sørensen.</p>
<p>""We were very encouraged by the impressive number of project proposals from a wide range of areas and are looking forward to introducing several new capacity and community-building activities in the fall,"" Sørensen said. ""This wide range of research initiatives will form a vibrant nucleus for Stanford's growing community of scholars of global development and poverty.""</p>

1,81586,9/17/13 0:00,Joshua Rauh to Launch Open Online Course on Retirement Planning,63,news/headlines/joshua-rauh-launch-massive-open-online-course-retirement-planning,"MOOC is designed for individuals who want to create a sound retirement plan, finance professionals, or citizens concerned about public pension policy.",150,"<p>Stanford Graduate School of Business will launch its first massive open online course (MOOC) in October, <a href=""http://online.stanford.edu/course/rauh-finance"" target=""_blank"">The Finance of Retirement and Pensions</a>, led by finance professor and pension expert <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/joshua-d-rauh"">Joshua Rauh</a>. The course, which runs for eight weeks starting October 14, 2013, will help participants become more informed decision makers about their own retirement portfolios and about related government programs and policies. Prospective participants may find more information, including a video overview, and register for the course <a href=""http://online.stanford.edu/course/rauh-finance"" target=""_blank"">online</a>.</p>
<p>This inaugural Stanford GSB MOOC is part of the school's initiative to explore the most productive ways to use educational technology. ""We see educational technology as an important way to enhance the on-campus experience for our students, as well as a way to have a larger global impact by leveraging Stanford resources,"" says <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/garth-saloner"">Garth Saloner</a>, dean of Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>According to finance professor Rauh, Americans are more responsible for their own retirement than ever before, and so the open access of the MOOC format is well suited to his course's subject matter. ""Most individuals in the developed world hope or expect to retire someday — to stop working and start living off of their savings, combined with income from pension systems such as Social Security,"" he observes. ""However, for many people today, their plans to retire are threatened by financial realities.</p>
<p>""Our goal is to help people make better decisions about their own retirement portfolio and investments, and to shed light on U.S. policies that have important implications for retirees and taxpayers,"" he says.</p>
<p>With that goal in mind, Rauh explains that the people who will be most interested in his course are individuals who want to develop or enhance their financial plan for retirement, finance professionals in the retirement fund space, and taxpayers who want to know more about government-funded retirement programs and their sustainability.</p>
<p>Rauh's eight-week class is comprised of two 45-minute online teaching modules each week. Each of the 45-minute modules is, in turn, comprised of easy-to-digest 5- to 7-minute segments that can be viewed at any time. Additional course components include assignments, quizzes, a team project, interactive webinars, forums led by Stanford GSB alumni, and weekly updates from Rauh. Participants can expect to spend a minimum of four hours a week on all of the course elements.</p>
<h2>MOOC Culminates in Public Pension Symposium</h2>
<p>In addition to some of the unique collaborative elements of the course,<em> The Finance of Retirement and Pensions</em> will culminate in an interactive symposium about the challenges of U.S. pension systems. Called ""Innovative Ideas for the Future of U.S. Public Sector Pensions,"" the symposium will be held in January 2014 at Stanford Graduate School of Business. The event will feature representatives of the MOOC teams with the five most promising ideas for pension reform, who will present their proposals to a distinguished panel of faculty and experts in finance and public policy. Expenses will be covered by Stanford GSB in collaboration with the <a href=""http://www.hoover.org"" target=""_blank"">Hoover Institution</a>.</p>
<h2>Educational Technology at Stanford GSB</h2>
<p>To develop the course — which is hosted on the <a href=""https://novoed.com/"" target=""_blank"">NovoED</a> online learning platform — Rauh worked closely with a dedicated, Stanford GSB course development team that includes instructional designers, motion graphics designers, and video producers. This team was developed under the direction of Ranga Jayaraman, associate dean and chief information officer at Stanford GSB, who describes some of the distinctive features developed for this MOOC, including video lectures that are saved in a presentation format, so that participants can easily review key concepts without having to search through the video lectures; illustrations and motion graphics that enhance the learning experience; and live, news-style webcasts with Rauh serving as host and experts joining via the web.</p>
<p>Jayaraman puts this MOOC in the context of other educational technology projects underway at the school, explaining that one particularly valuable educational technology model being used is the ""flipped classroom."" This model allows faculty members to deliver selected instructional content online, which frees up classroom time for enhanced discussion and more interactive formats that reinforce the material and enhance learning. In fact, Rauh will be using the video lectures from the MOOC as part of a class he is teaching this fall at Stanford GSB.</p>
<p>The school is also employing high-definition distance education technologies for a certificate program in innovation and entrepreneurship — called ""<a href=""/programs/stanford-ignite"">Stanford Ignite</a>"" — launching this year in Bangalore, India, and Paris, France. Stanford GSB has equipped several on-campus facilities with technology that will simulate the classroom experience for participants in international locations off-campus, while allowing faculty to be physically located at Stanford.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the <a href=""http://engineering.stanford.edu"" target=""_blank"">Stanford School of Engineering</a>, the Graduate School of Business also offers a joint online <a href=""http://create.stanford.edu/index.php"" target=""_blank"">Certificate Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a>, which can be taken at any time by anyone anywhere in the world. Participants may take one course or earn a certificate after completing 8 online courses on topics from <a href=""http://create.stanford.edu/courses/building-business-models.php"" target=""_blank"">Building Business Models</a> and <a href=""http://create.stanford.edu/courses/empathize-and-prototype.php"" target=""_blank"">Empathize and Prototype: A Hands-On Dive into the Key Tools of Design Thinking</a>.</p>
<p>""The MOOC platform and distance technologies allow us to extend our expertise beyond our physical campus,"" says Jayaraman, ""while other educational technologies allow us to strengthen our core on-campus programs, like our two-year MBA. Together, they serve as a foundation from which we can explore other emerging forms of educational technology that will continue to transform the teaching and learning experience.""</p>

1,4482,10/15/01 0:00,Stanford Business School's Spence Wins Nobel Prize in Economics,63,news/headlines/spence_2001nobel.shtml,"Research by Spence, who won the prize with two other academics, explains how information affects markets.",105,"<p><a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/michael-spence"">A. Michael Spence</a>, Philip H. Knight Professor, Emeritus, and former Dean of Stanford Graduate School of Business, was awarded the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Wednesday, Oct. 10. He shares the prestigious $1 million prize with George A. Akerlof of the University of California at Berkeley and Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University.</p>
<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize for the trio's work in information economics. In the 1970s, the laureates laid the groundwork for a theory about markets with so-called ""asymmetric information."" Their work explained how agents with differing amounts of information affect many different kinds of markets. In its announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that the winners' contributions ""form the core of modern information economics."" Their work has led to applications in areas ranging from agricultural markets to modern financial markets, according to the academy.</p>
<p>""Mike's fundamental insight lets us understand a huge range of real world phenomena from the connection of earnings and education through competitive pricing to the use of apparently uninformative advertising,"" said colleague John Roberts, the John H. and Irene S. Scully Professor of Economics, Strategic Management, and International Business at Stanford's Graduate School of Business. ""Such insights come very, very, rarely.""</p>
<p>""The recognition the Nobel committee has bestowed on Michael Spence reaffirms our conviction that a great business school must be driven by the desire to produce original research and create knowledge that benefits society,"" said Stanford President John Hennessy. ""Professor Spence brings great honor to that idea and great honor to Stanford. His contributions to the university — as teacher, scholar and dean of the business school — have always been on the highest order. I know I speak for the entire Stanford community when I say that we are proud to call him a colleague.""</p>
<p>As a result of Spence's award, Stanford is now home to 16 living Nobel laureates — 13 affiliated with the university and three affiliated with the Hoover Institution.</p>
<p>""We're immensely proud and very pleased that Michael's work has been recognized,"" said Robert Joss, dean of Stanford's Graduate School of Business. Spence is the third Nobel laureate in economics at the Graduate School of Business following awards to <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/myron-s-scholes"">Myron S. Scholes</a>, the Frank E. Buck Professor of Finance, Emeritus, in 1997 and <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/william-f-sharpe"">William Sharpe</a>, the STANCO 25 Professor of Finance, Emeritus, in 1990.</p>
<p>Reached in the middle of the night at his vacation home in Hawaii, Spence, 58, said, ""It's wonderful. It's an incredible honor to be recognized for something that people perceive as moving the ball down the field in one's academic discipline.""</p>
<p>Research into ""asymmetric information"" gave economists a way to measure such things as risks faced by a lender who lacked information about a borrower's credit worthiness. It also explored how people with inside knowledge of a technology company's financial prospects gain an edge over other investors, while people who don't fully understand a company's finances may invest unwisely. The theory also helps economists explain why the recent bubble in high-technology stocks burst.</p>
<p>Akerlof showed that imperfect information on the part of lenders or prospective car-buyers caused borrowers with weak repayment prospects or sellers of low-quality cars to crowd others out of the market.</p>
<p>Spence's work showed that under certain conditions well-informed players can improve their market outcome by ""signaling"" their private information to those who know less. His economic models demonstrated how information could be used to communicate a superior position. For example, an auto dealer might be able to signal he had a better car by offering a warranty. The management of a firm might use an additional tax cost of dividends to signal high profitability. ""Spence's thesis was one of the great milestones of economic theory in the past fifty years,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/david-m-kreps"">David Kreps</a>, the Paul E. Holden Professor of Economics at Stanford's Graduate School of Business. ""It was one of my great pleasures to supervise this dissertation,"" says Kenneth J. Arrow, a 1972 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics and the Joan Kenney Professor of Economics, Emeritus, at Stanford University. ""We had many exciting interchanges as he would come up with new results each day. It was clear at the time that he was breaking new ground.""</p>
<p>Stiglitz showed that a player with poor information can capture the information of someone with better data through ""screening"" such as providing choices from a menu of contracts for a transaction. Insurance companies, for example, are able to divide their clients into risk groups by offering different policies where lower premiums can be exchanged for a higher deductible. Stiglitz is the former Joan Kenney Professor of Economics at Stanford and was also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. ""The three laureates started a revolution in economics that has continued to this day,"" said Kreps.</p>
<p>Born in Montclair, NJ, and raised in Toronto, Canada, Spence earned his PhD at Harvard in 1972. He has held professorships at both Stanford Business School and Harvard and has also been dean at both universities. He served as Dean of Stanford's Graduate School of Business from 1990 to 1999. After stepping down from his post as Dean at the Business School, he became a partner in Oak Hill Capital Partners and Oak Hill Venture Partners where he has managed a number of high technology investments. He has continued his activities at the Business School, most recently co-developing and co-teaching a course on e-commerce.</p>
<p>Spence earned his undergraduate degree in philosophy at Princeton summa cum laude and was selected for a Rhodes Scholarship. He was awarded a B.A. from Oxford in mathematics and earned his Ph.D in economics at Harvard. He taught at Stanford as an associate professor of economics from 1973 to 1975 when he became professor of economics and business administration at Harvard. In 1983, he was awarded the John Kenneth Galbraith Prize for excellence in teaching and the John Bates Clark medal for a ""significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge."" Spence served as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard from 1984 until 1990 when he returned to Stanford Business School as dean.</p>
<p>Spence sits on the boards of Nike, General Mills, and Siebel Systems. He has authored three books and about 50 articles in professional journals.</p>",,,302626,,,,Nobel Foundation Press Release | Colleagues Toast Spence,http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/2001/press.html | http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/october17/spence_video-1017.html,,,,,,Spence on Risk,http://youtu.be/yGrYvAl9mjE,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,Economics,,,,,,,,,,Barbara Buell,,a

The project will take place during an upcoming <a href=""/exed/cfi"">Customer-Focused Innovation</a> program to be offered October 30-November 4, 2011. Applications are now open.</p>
<p>Ten-year-old JetBlue, an airline pioneer that offers customer-friendly travel amenities including leather seats, satellite television and award-winning customer service, will be featured as a case study in a week-long class project to immerse participating executives in the practice of corporate innovation. <a href=""/exed/cfi/"">Customer-Focused Innovation</a> marries business school classroom models with hands-on field research and design thinking developed at the Institute, also known as the d.school, to help executives better understand customer experiences, develop deeper customer insights, diffuse customer learning throughout their organizations, and improve overall customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>""Executives will immerse themselves in the San Francisco International Airport travel experience and build a deeper understanding of both the customer's needs and JetBlue's practices in an exercise designed to re-imagine and potentially enhance that experience. The practical skills the executives gain will be applicable across industries,"" says Robert Sutton, Professor of Management Science and Engineering at the Stanford Engineering School and professor by courtesy at the Graduate School of Business. ""This program fuses the idea of so-called 'clean models' of the business school classroom with the 'dirty hands' of the design school process,"" says Graduate School of Business organizational behavior professor Hayagreeva Rao, who codirects Customer-Focused Innovation with Sutton. ""Combining these is a powerful experience.""</p>
<p>Design expert <a href=""http://dschool.stanford.edu/bio/perry-klebahn/"" target=""_blank"">Perry Klebahn</a>, the inventor of the modern snowshoe and an associate consulting professor at the d.school, will be working closely with participants on the JetBlue project during the program. Klebahn is founder and former CEO of Atlas Snowshoes, former COO of Patagonia, and former CEO of Timbuk2.</p>
<p>The collaboration will allow JetBlue to gain independent insight into their airport experience at SFO from Stanford academics and participating executives. Participants will focus on disembarking, navigating the gate and airport, getting luggage, finding and meeting ground transportation ? both from the traveler's perspective and the JetBlue crewmember's experience.</p>
<p>Key features of the Stanford collaboration will have program participants conducting:</p>
<p>Interviews of JetBlue's key management personnel Observation of real travelers disembarking at SFO Ideation, design, prototyping and iteration of new procedures and experiences Presentation of proposed models to JetBlue management</p>
<p>""We're always looking for fresh and innovative ideas to enhance the 'JetBlue Experience' for our Customers. The Stanford School program is an exciting opportunity to tap into some of the most dynamic innovation experts in academia to take an innovative look at the airport experience, said Marty St. George, the airline's senior vice president of marketing and commercial strategy.</p>

1,4501,11/30/10 0:00,Stanford Launches Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance,68,news/headlines/steyer-taylor-center.html,Stanford GSB and Stanford's Law School have combined forces to push clean energy technology to deployment through a focus on policy and finance.,144,"<p><a href=""https://www.law.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Stanford Law School</a> and Stanford GSB today announced the establishment of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, an interdisciplinary center to study and advance the development and deployment of clean energy technologies through innovative policy and finance.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://steyertaylor.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance</a> will be housed at both the Law School and Stanford GSB, bringing together the best minds from both disciplines to advance the development, financing, management and regulation of the clean energy technology sector. The center is the latest of Stanford University's efforts to address comprehensively the global energy challenge — from advancing energy efficiency to developing and deploying renewable energy, to reducing the effects of fossil fuels. The center's focus on policy and finance solutions will complement the work of other institutes, as well: the Precourt Institute for Energy; the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy; the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies' Program on Energy and Sustainable Development; and the Stanford Environmental and Energy Policy Analysis Center at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.</p>
<p>The center has been made possible by a $7 million gift from Stanford alumni Thomas Steyer (MBA '83) and his wife, Kat Taylor (JD/MBA '86). Its executive director will be <a href=""https://www.law.stanford.edu/profile/dan-reicher"" target=""_blank"">Dan Reicher</a> (JD '83), who has also been appointed professor of the practice of law at the Law School and lecturer at Stanford GSB. Reicher was assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy during the Clinton administration. A member of President Obama's transition team, he was most recently director of climate change and energy initiatives at Google. He has strong energy and environmental credentials and extensive experience in government, law, business and venture capital, and the non-profit sector.</p>
<p>""We believe that Stanford is uniquely positioned to change our nation's attitudes and capabilities regarding how we make and use energy. What our university did for the information revolution, it must now do for the energy revolution,"" said Steyer of his and Taylor's gift.</p>
<p>The TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy, a research center within the Precourt Institute for Energy which launched in 2009, was also funded by generous support from Thomas Steyer and Kat Taylor. Steyer is a Stanford trustee and managing partner of Farallon Capital Management; Taylor is active in a variety of public benefit and philanthropic ventures. Steyer founded Farallon in 1986. He is also managing director of Hellman & Friedman, a San Francisco-based private equity firm. He previously worked for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>With a strong base at both Stanford Law School and Stanford GSB, the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance will provide a broad platform for research on energy policy and finance — particularly legislative, regulatory and business tools—that increase public support for and the flow of capital to clean energy technologies. It will produce world-class research for policymakers, the business community, and technology leaders to help inform and resolve energy problems at the global, national, state and local levels. It will help coordinate related work being done in Stanford's other centers, schools and departments to enhance teaching, training and research across the campus.</p>
<p>""Energy may be our most pressing public policy problem today,"" said Stanford Law School Dean Larry Kramer. ""Our success in addressing it will determine much about our future — both economically and environmentally. And any solutions require working across disciplines and understanding the critical role of both law and finance in making technological innovations workable. That being so, it is really quite astonishing that there is nothing like this new center on energy policy and finance at any other law school. We are absolutely delighted to launch this collaborative effort with the Stanford Graduate School of Business and expect to make strong contributions to national and global efforts to develop sustainable energy.""</p>
<p>By collaborating with Stanford GSB, the center will leverage business school expertise to help resolve the challenge of financing clean technologies from conception to market and educate future leaders of managed organizations to incorporate sustainability in operations and strategy. Financing can be exceptionally difficult since clean technology innovations may require billions of dollars to scale up from venture capital-backed pilot projects to commercially financeable production facilities. ""Interdisciplinary centers like this help us create the conditions for innovation to flourish, so that faculty and students can help drive solutions to pressing global problems such as creating more sustainable energy systems,"" said Stanford GSB Dean Garth Saloner.</p>
<p>""U.S. and global energy systems are plagued by serious economic, environmental and national security problems,"" said the center's executive director, Professor Dan Reicher. ""In their resolution lie vast opportunities for job creation, pollution control and reduced international tensions. The successful integration of policy and finance is key to addressing these problems and seizing the unprecedented opportunities. We need smart policy to set the stage for fundamental change in our energy systems and innovative finance to make things happen — from early stage innovation to the broad-scale deployment of clean energy technologies. I look forward to helping the center become a catalyst for an environmentally and economically sustainable energy future.""</p>
<p>Reicher added, ""I'm particularly pleased that Tom Steyer and Kat Taylor are backing the center given their long-standing commitment to clean energy as well as their recent success in building a bipartisan coalition — spanning the business, environmental, environmental justice, and national security communities — that ensured the continued implementation of California's path-breaking climate change program.""</p>",,,309541 | 303071,,,,Stanford Law School | Program on Energy and Sustainable Development,http://www.law.stanford.edu | http://pesd.stanford.edu/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,Monument to Change with green and blue flip digits,,Finance,Energy,,Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell,a,

<p>Joss, visiting India this week, joined senior executives from Reliance Industries at Reliance corporate offices in Mumbai to ink the agreement.</p>
<p>In the first stage, fellowship applicants complete the Reliance Dhirubhai Fellows application between May 15 and July 15, 2008. Finalists will be selected based on merit, commitment to developing India, and financial need based on a review of each individual's personal resources.</p>
<p>In the second stage, those finalists will go on to the standard application process for the Stanford MBA Program by October 2008. Stanford may select up to five Reliance Dhirubhai Fellows from among the finalists based on its primary admission criteria of intellectual vitality, demonstrated leadership potential, and personal qualities and contributions.</p>
<p>The Reliance Dhirubhai Fellows will receive full financial support, including tuition, course-related fees, living stipend, and travel allowance — an estimated $83,000 total value per Fellow per year (see <a href=""/programs/mba/financial-aid/cost-summary"">full cost summary</a>). Funding is automatically renewed for the second year if the student maintains good academic standing and community citizenship at Stanford Business School.

Established in 1960 by the <a href=""http://www.cfapubs.org/loi/faj""><em>Financial Analysts Journal</em></a> the award recognizes excellence in financial writing.</p>
<p>In his winning article, ""<a href=""/faculty-research/publications/adaptive-asset-allocation-policies"">Adaptive Asset Allocation Policies</a>,"" published in the May/June 2010 issue of the <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>, Sharpe, who is STANCO 25 Professor of Finance, Emeritus, proposes a much simpler approach to asset allocation than traditional methods, one that adapts to market movements by taking into account changes in the outstanding market values of major asset classes. Such a policy considers important information, reduces or avoids contrarian behavior, and can be followed by a majority of investors.</p>

<p>Sharpe shared the <a href=""/news/headlines/sharpe_nobel.shtml"">1990 Nobel Prize for Economics</a> with Harry Markowitz and Merton Miller; he was cited for his work in developing models to aid investment decisions.

<p>Sharpe, a native of Cambridge, Mass., received all three of his degrees from the University of California in Los Angeles. He arrived at Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1970 as a professor of finance, retiring to emeritus status in 1999.</p>

1,4169,1/1/09 0:00,Business School Announces Comprehensive Budget Reductions,57,news/headlines/budget09.html,"Plan driven by decreased endowment revenue, a projected drop in executive education revenue, and an expected decline in alumni-giving.",134,"<p>In response to decreased endowment revenue, a projected drop in executive education revenue and expected alumni-giving declines, the Graduate School of Business announced a comprehensive expense reduction plan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The declining revenue sources, triggered by a financial downturn of unprecedented reach and scale, have created a $15 million (10 percent) shortfall in the current year budget at the Business School. Moreover, impacts are expected to persist due to the effects of the recession on Business School revenues.</p>
<p>The endowment payout will continue to decline more over the next two years as the full impact of the decline in asset values is reflected in the payout. ""We're essentially looking at an endowment revenue decline for three years,"" said Dan Rudolph, senior associate dean for operations.</p>
<p>Academic priorities were protected as part of the strategic budget process, including student programs, the new MBA curriculum introduced in 2007, financial aid, the Sloan Master's Program, faculty research and the school's PhD program.</p>
<p>As part of the plan to reduce expenses, 49 staff members (approximately 12 percent) were laid off. Another eight people were put on a reduced schedule, and 12 contractor or fixed-term positions were eliminated. Expenses such as travel, food, library services, marketing activities and printing, among other things, also were cut.</p>
<p>""This was the most painful decision I have had to make in my nearly 10 years as dean,"" said Robert L. Joss, dean of the Graduate School of Business. ""We regret the need to lay off staff members who have been dedicated to the school and its educational mission, but by cutting expenses now we can ensure our long-term financial health. Every effort will be made to support employees as they transition out of our workforce.""</p>
<p>Laid off staff members will receive an enhanced university severance package, as was previously announced by the campus for all employees who may be laid of between now and June 30. The affected employees also will receive severance based on length of service and five months of outplacement job search support, as is standard campuswide. Outplacement specialists were at the school on Tuesday to provide information and support as employees learned of their layoffs.</p>
<p>Overall, Stanford University endowment results are expected to be down between 20 and 30 percent this year, according to estimates from Provost John Etchemendy. By contrast, during the 2001-03 downturn, the Stanford endowment was down about 5 percent over two years. The Business School has been especially hard hit, as a larger proportion of its revenue comes from the endowment and alumni giving than in some other areas of the university.</p>
<p>With these cuts, the Business School has put a plan in place to ensure future financial stability. In a Jan. 7 Q&A in Stanford Report, the provost said that it is important to remember that even with a 20 to 30 percent investment decline, the university's endowment would be about the size it was in 2005. It was a great university then and it will remain a great university in 2010, he said. The same is true of the Business School, Joss said.</p>

Knight, MBA '62, will give $105 million to Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. It is believed to be the largest gift ever given to a business school.</p>
<p>The majority of the gift — $100 million — will be used to construct a new $275 million campus for the Business School, to be named the Knight Management Center. Concept and site approval for the collection of eight buildings to be set around three quadrangles on the Stanford campus were given by the Stanford University Board of Trustees on June 15. After raising the balance of needed funds for the campus, the School plans to break ground on the new management center in 2008. The remaining $5 million of the Knight gift will be used to match other donors' gifts for faculty endowment.</p>
<p>""Phil Knight has once again shown the depth of his commitment to Stanford's future,"" said Stanford University President John Hennessy. ""The enormous generosity of this gift will enable the Graduate School of Business to create a truly unique environment for its graduate programs and enrich Stanford's efforts to encourage multidisciplinary teaching and research that transcends traditional boundaries. We are most grateful for this vote of confidence from Phil and look forward to the extraordinary intellectual innovation I'm certain this gift will foster.""</p>
<p>Knight's commitment comes just weeks after the Graduate School of Business faculty adopted plans for sweeping changes in the School's MBA curriculum to be implemented in the fall of 2007.</p>
<p>The MBA Program redesign builds on the School's small size to create a highly personalized educational experience with more seminars and varied classes for students. ""A new curriculum, increased integration with the University, and a new campus: This is a very exciting time for the Business School,"" said Robert L. Joss, the Philip H. Knight Professor and Dean of the Graduate School of Business. ""Phil's commitment is the linchpin which will allow us to create a physical environment to support new methods of teaching management and leadership while also inviting more collaboration from across Stanford.""</p>
<p>The Knight Management Center design will include more flexible classroom space for the greater number of small classes and seminars the school will offer. The new campus is also designed to support more interaction with University faculty and students, including facilities for cross-disciplinary classes and lectures. ""Stanford Business School was an important part of my life,"" said Knight. ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to give back to the School and help it continue to push the boundaries of excellence in management education.""</p>
<p>The center plans include a 450-seat auditorium, classrooms, breakout study rooms, dining facilities, a career management center, executive education space, and faculty and staff offices. It will be outfitted with state-of-the-art instructional technology. When completed, the center is expected to comprise approximately 340,000 square feet. This will replace the current 255,000 square feet of outdated Business School facilities, resulting in a net additional 85,000 square feet occupied by the School on the Stanford campus.</p>
<p>Knight previously has contributed substantial support to the University, including funds for the dean's professorship, construction of the Business School's Knight Building in 1999, and gifts to the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation.</p>",,,302296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,,,,,Nike,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell,,

<p>Nominations from students communicated a deep sense of respect for Parker' s ability to inspire, teach, and make learning enjoyable. In the words of one student: ""He was amazing at not making anyone feel intimidated""¦, and everyone felt comfortable participating. We all laughed frequently every class and really enjoyed being there.""¦ He was definitely my favorite professor.""</p>
<p>""[His corporate finance] course was one of the most fun courses I have taken,"" shared one student. Another wrote: ""[He] was amazingly gifted at making [this subject] accessible to everyone, from the strongest quant jock to the serious poet. Although I had him in an 8 a.m. class""¦, I looked forward to his class every day.""</p>
<p>In accepting the Distinguished Teaching Award at a recent noontime ceremony, Parker acknowledged the support of wife, Joan, ""who was impressed,"" said Parker, ""but she said I still have to take out the trash."" Parker also expressed his gratitude for his role models: the teachers he had throughout many years as well as colleague James Van Horne, a two-time winner of the Distinguished Teaching Award whom Parker considers ""a master teacher in every regard.""</p>
<p>Parker has a unique perspective on the Stanford Business School as an MBA and PhD alumnus. Since joining the faculty in 1973 to teach and direct the Sloan Master' s Program, he also has overseen the School' s executive education program and served as senior associate dean for academic affairs and director of the MBA Program. ""I' ve done everything there is to do here except serve as dean and clip the flowers,"" quipped Parker in an interview. Three years ago, he was honored with the Robert T. Davis Award presented by the faculty to a colleague in recognition of lifetime service to the Business School.</p>

Most recently, Parker, an avid horseman, was appointed to head the advisory council of the Stanford Barn when Leland Stanford's Victorian horse barn was revamped recently.</p>
<p>""If you're lucky enough to teach at Stanford, and you're lucky enough to teach finance, and you're lucky enough to have the kinds of good students I've had at Stanford all these years, it's pretty darn easy to like your work,"" Parker said.</p>

1,80496,5/1/13 0:00,"Stanford Sloan Master's Program Redesigned, Renamed MSx",55,news/headlines/redesigned-sloan-masters-curriculum-named-stanford-msx-program-experienced-leaders,Full-time program has evolved to extended 12-month format and expanded enrollment for both self-funded and sponsored students.,126,"<p>Stanford Graduate School of Business has renamed its legacy Sloan Master's Program the <a href=""/programs/msx"">Stanford MSx Program</a> for experienced leaders, reflecting strategic changes in the program over the last two years. The formal name of the program will now be the Stanford Master of Science in Management for Experienced Leaders (Stanford MSx). As in the past, the program will remain one of the school's premier degree programs, through which students, who are designated Fellows, earn the MS in Management.</p>
<p>The one-year, full-time program is designed specifically for mid-career professionals with at least eight years of work experience and a desire to develop their strengths in general management, leadership, and innovation. Each year, this select cohort has included a diverse representation of countries and industries around the world.</p>
<p>The name change accompanies a collection of important enhancements in the program's design and curriculum, in keeping with the needs of a diversifying student population. The program is now more focused on teaching leadership skills and innovation, in pursuit of taking ideas — within corporations or an entrepreneurial environment — to the next level. Electives aimed squarely at the more experienced Fellows, who typically come to the program with 12 years of managerial experience, include <em>Generative Leadership</em> and <em>Executive Communication Strategies</em>.</p>
<p>""The program's academic goal is to provide a deeper command of all disciplines required of a general manager, while leveraging the expertise they have already developed in their field,"" says Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Madhav Rajan, who oversees both the MBA and MSx programs at Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""Fellows bring a wealth of global experience to Stanford, which enhances their own classroom discussions, while also exposing our MBA students to perspectives that have been tested by real-world practice.""</p>
<h2>Key Changes: 12-Month Program and 57% Expanded Enrollment</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the first time this academic year, the school extended the program from 10 months to 12 months. The program now begins in July and concludes in June.</li>
<li>With rising demand among mid-career leaders for a one-year, full-time program, the school increased enrollment to 88 in 2013-14, up 57% from 56 in 2010-11.</li>
<li>Courses retooled exclusively for the Stanford MSx cohort acknowledge the significant managerial experience of the Fellows.</li>
<li>New curricular design offers differentiated core course offerings and greater flexibility to take advantage of a broader range of electives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Education for Experienced Business People</h2>
<p>""The new name articulates what makes the program distinct in management education,"" says Mike Hochleutner, director of the Stanford MSx Program. ""First, unlike most MBA programs, where participants typically have 3 to 4 years of work experience, our students average 10 or more years of experience. Second, unlike Executive MBAs (EMBAs), which are part-time degree programs, this is an immersive, full-time experience. Finally, unlike many Master in Management degrees, which are usually focused on an industry or function, this is a degree in general management.""</p>
<h2>A Move Toward Leadership and Innovation Training</h2>
<p>When established 55 years ago at the behest of industrialist Alfred Sloan, the Stanford Sloan Master's Program was primarily conceived as company-sponsored education for American executives. Over the years, and especially in the last 10 years, more individuals have sought access to the degree program without corporate sponsorship. Participants are now roughly one-third sponsored and two-thirds self-funded. Additionally, as the nature of corporations has evolved toward flatter organizations, and as global competition has increased the need to move projects forward quickly regardless of the size of a company, the demand for leadership training, innovative thinking, and entrepreneurial skills has grown significantly.</p>
<p>""The program incorporates a blend of the leadership teaching we offer in our MBA program with learning techniques we use in executive education, to assure Fellows build self-awareness and understand how to be adaptive,"" says Hochleutner. ""It includes assessments, executive modules, coaching, study trips, and active opportunities to 'lead-by-doing,' both within class and beyond.""</p>
<p>The Fellows in the Stanford MSx Program are a global group, with 77% of the 2013 graduating class from countries outside the United States. Each brings his or her distinct perspective and experience to both classroom and informal discussions. Fellows live and study together, creating a challenging intellectual community that thrives after the program. Since most Fellows are already established in both careers and personal lives, their partners and families often come to campus with them, and will continue to be an integral part of the Stanford MSx community.</p>
<h2>The Sloan Legacy</h2>
<p>The Stanford <a href=""/stanford-gsb-experience/leadership/history/stanford-sloan-program-50"">Sloan Program</a> was founded in 1957 with partial support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The Foundation provided funds for six doctoral students to participate, alongside company-sponsored business executives, in a program that aimed to shape the future leaders and teachers of business. The Sloan Foundation also funded two other Sloan Programs, at MIT and London Business School. Since then, each program has evolved in a slightly different direction.</p>
<p>While the Foundation's financial support for the program at Stanford ended in the 1960s, the program continued to gain stature among corporate sponsors. Over the years, program graduates have served in CEO roles at many prominent companies and organizations, including Boeing, BP, Pfizer, Yves Saint Laurent, and AARP. The previous dean of Stanford Graduate School of Business, Robert Joss, was also a Fellow. In more recent years, the program has included entrepreneurs, financiers, and social innovators, alongside managers from more traditional enterprises. The program has remained one of Stanford University's most prestigious offerings and is expected to continue flourishing in its new format.</p>",,,302531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,,Education | Management | Leadership,,,,,,,,,Barbara Buell,,

Bass says his job description is simple: Figure out what needs to be done and do it.</p>
<p>Over time, says the founder and president of Keystone Inc., he has distilled and refined the business concepts he learned at Stanford Graduate School of Business into ""three inviolate principles"":</p>
<p>""Set out to find people of great skill, integrity, creativity, and judgment. ""Put them in situations where the wind is at their backs. ""Design a structure that aligns their interests closely with mine, support them when they ask for help, but otherwise empower them to do what they do best.""</p>
<p>Bass made the remarks at a formal dinner Feb. 23 honoring him as the 35th recipient of the Arbuckle Award presented by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association. In accepting the award, Bass, who earned his MBA in 1974, credited faculty members with instilling in him ""the core GSB values: uncompromising passion for entrepreneurship, and the efficient functioning of firms and markets.""</p>
<p>Keystone, the firm he founded and heads, invests in a wide range of industries. He is the founder of the Oak Hill family of investment partnerships. He has been a major investor in Washington Mutual, Taft Broadcasting, Westin Hotels, Wometco Cable TV, Macmillan Inc., the Times Publishing Company, Bell & Howell, American Savings and Loan, Oreck, and Williams Scotsman.</p>
<p>Bass was introduced by Dean Emeritus Michael Spence, a partner in Oak Hill Securities, who cited Bass for his commitment to social responsibility. ""There is no sharp separation of investment returns narrowly defined and overriding social values,"" said Spence. ""The organization won't invest in enterprises that adversely affect the environment, the moral fiber of society, or broadly that impair the health of people.""</p>
<p>Spence also cited Bass and his wife, Anne, for their many philanthropic interests, while at the same time noting their desire not to seek public recognition. ""Together they have set the high water mark in philanthropy for insight, impact, leverage, modesty, and humility,"" said Spence.</p>
<p>Their interests and investments have focused on education, children's health, and the environment. Bass said he has taken lessons learned at the school and in his business career into his nonprofit activities. ""It has been gratifying to me to be able to make a difference. I have learned a great deal about management from my not-for-profit involvement, not only from addressing a succession of challenging issues but also from experience with very sophisticated, well-run organizations.""</p>
<p>Bass is currently a member of the board of trustees of Stanford University, the board of the Stanford Management Company, and the advisory council to Stanford GSB. Bass is also chairman emeritus of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.</p>",,,302626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,,,,,,MBA,,,,,Barbara Buell,,

<p>""International student exchanges such as this Stanford-IIMB program will contribute to the expanded global offerings in the new curriculum we will put in place in fall of 2007,"" said Dan Rudolph, senior associate dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, at a press conference in Mumbai today. ""Beginning with the next incoming class, every MBA student at Stanford will be required to participate in an international experience such as a global study trip, overseas service-learning trip, or international internship.""</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Rudolph introduced a two-day multidisciplinary executive education program jointly sponsored by the schools of Business and Engineering at Stanford. This first-of-its-kind Stanford Executive Education Program has drawn nearly 200 business leaders, corporate leaders, Stanford alumni, and distinguished guests to the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel.</p>
<p>""In recognition of the growing importance of managing across cultures in a global economy, this initiative will provide for unique cross-cultural learning of business and management in the United States and India,"" said <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/v-srinivasan"">V. ""Seenu"" Srinivasan</a>, the Adams Distinguished Professor of Management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and one of the architects of the program.</p>
<p>Srinivasan and G. Shainesh, associate professor of marketing at IIMB and the program's co-architect, signed the memorandum of understanding in a January 5 ceremony in Bangalore. Additional signatories are Prakash G. Apte, director of IIMB, and John Roberts, senior associate dean for academic affairs at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>""We expect this program of hosting and exchange to foster strong, lifelong relationships between future business leaders throughout India, America, and the world,"" said Shainesh.</p>
<p>""We are pleased to be the first postgraduate institution in India to partner with Stanford GSB in an academic program within its MBA curriculum,"" said Apte, who is also a professor of economics and social science. ""We have much in common, including our location in the technology and entrepreneurship centers of our respective countries. Also, we share an underlying belief that world-class business leaders are not mass-produced, but nurtured and developed in strategically small teams and classes."" IIMB and Stanford Business School each year admit approximately 240 and 365 MBA students, respectively.</p>
<p>In the program's inaugural year, 16 students from each school will work together in eight small teams of four students, two from each school. In subsequent years, the program will expand to 20 students from each institution. In addition to administering the program, professors Srinivasan and Shainesh will oversee the academic fulfillment of the 2-unit course.</p>
<p>In a sequential two-way exchange, Stanford Business students will go to IIMB for one week (September 16-22, 2007), and IIMB students will visit Stanford GSB for one week (December 2-8, 2007).</p>
<p>Exchange visits will be organized along three core aspects: academics, business, and social activities. Components of the program are expected to include visits to locally based companies, readings, presentations, classroom interaction, and lectures delivered by faculty, business professionals, and possibly public-sector leaders. The program will conclude with student presentations during the IIMB students' visit to Stanford.</p>
<p>This represents the second international student exchange program for the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

In recent years Allison's career has been devoted to solving some of the most difficult problems affecting finance and the U.S. economy. As the U.S. Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability and Counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury, Allison supervised the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) until stepping down last September. The former chairman, president, and CEO of pension fund TIAA-CREF, Allison also served for 28 years as a leader at multiple levels of management at Merrill Lynch, rising to President, COO, and board director.</p>

""At this time of tremendous uncertainty and instability in the world, Herb's recognized contributions to both the corporate world and the community serve as inspiration for the kind of principled leader our students want to become. On graduation day, Herb's personal journey and character stand as an example of the GSB's call to change lives, change organizations, change the world.""</p>
<p>Before earning his MBA at Stanford in 1971, Allison served four years as a naval officer, including a year in Vietnam. After business school, Allison began his financial services career as an associate at Merrill Lynch where he helped start the company's first investment banking office in Europe, eventually going to Iran to help start the firm's first business in a domestic capital market outside the United States. He stepped down in 1999, served as National Finance Chairman for John McCain's 2000 Presidential campaign and then became president and CEO of the Alliance for Lifelong Learning, Inc., a joint venture of Oxford, Stanford, and Yale universities. </p>
<p>From 2002 to 2008 Allison headed TIAA-CREF where he oversaw a massive restructuring program. He took the reins at Fannie Mae in September 2008 when the organization was placed into conservatorship during the mortgage crisis. He was appointed to the U.S. Treasury position in 2009 to oversee the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the $700 billion fund to purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen the financial sector of the economy.</p>
<p>In recognition of a four-decade career of visionary service, Allison was honored with the GSB's Excellence in Leadership Award in 2005.  In addition to the GSB's Advisory Council, which he chaired from 1999 to 2001, he has served on a number of boards and advisory committees, including Time Warner, the New York Stock Exchange, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, and the Yale School of Management. Working alongside Kien Pham, MBA '85, who escaped by boat from his native Vietnam at age 19, Allison was founding chairman of the Vietnam Education Foundation, a federal agency that provides scholarships to Vietnamese college graduates so they can obtain advanced degrees in the United States. Allison obtained a BA in philosophy from Yale in 1965. His awards include the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat 'V,'; and U.S. Treasury's Meritorious Service Award.</p>

He founded and became CEO of the computer products firm Systems Industries. The chair seeks to recognize scholarship in nonprofit management.</p>
<p>Miller is social psychologist who has made contributions to the science of psychology. Recent work has focused on motivations underlying volunteerism and the conditions under which individuals and organizations abandon one course of action and pursue another. Endowed professorships are the highest honor the university can bestow and are crucial to the school's ability to recruit top scholars by offering recognition of academic achievement. Chairs may be created to honor individuals or organizations and may express a preference to honor a professor working in a specific academic area. At Stanford GSB they also include a distinctive black chair decorated with the university seal.</p>
<p>Jonathan Berk, whose research includes delegated money management, asset pricing, valuing growth potential, and interaction between labor and financial markets, is the new A.P. Giannini Professor of Finance. Berk's paper, ""A Critique of Size-Related Anomalies,"" was selected as one of the two best papers ever published in the Review of Financial Studies, and was also honored as one of the 100 seminal papers published by Oxford University Press. The chair was established in 1977 in honor of the founder of the Bank of Italy, the San Francisco institution that became Bank of America.</p>
<p>Macroeconomist Charles (Chad) Jones, whose research includes economic growth, income equality, and most recently macro eco of spending on health care, is the STANCO 25 Professor of Economics. The chair was established in 1993 by group of MBA alumni from the Class of '68.</p>
<p>Sarah Soule, who joined the Business School in 2008, is the latest Morgridge Professor of Organizational Behavior, a chair established in 2002 by John and Tasha Morgridge. John Morgridge, who today is a Business School faculty member, joined Cisco Systems in 1968 as president and CEO, and today serves as Cisco's chairman. Soule works on the sociology of social movements, addressing the diffusion of social movements and the impact those movements have on share prices of corporations they target. She has shown that the greatest impact on corporations occurs when labor or consumer issues are involved rather than environmental or moral issues.</p>
<p>Jesper Sørensen, the Walter Kenneth Kilpatrick Professor of Organizational Behavior, mixes labor market processes with organizational sociology. He specializes in the dynamics of organizational and strategic change, and their implications for individuals and their careers. His work of the dynamics of teams has led to new insights concerning how people respond to changes in the racial composition of their work groups. Sørensen is engaged in a large-scale project on the determinants of entrepreneurial behavior exploring questions such as how work environments shape rates of entrepreneurship. The Kilpatrick chair, created in the 1950s, honors a 1908 U.S. Naval Academy graduate who served as chief of staff for the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Atlantic fleet, and earned the Legion of Merit and Gold Star for outstanding service.</p>",,,302046 | 302431 | 302076 | 302291 | 302621 | 302616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/hBSPKFx,Monument to Change with green and blue flip digits,,,,,,,,,,,,Katie Pandes,,

In addition to faculty, Silicon Valley-based business school alumni with expertise in operations will return to Stanford to coach working groups during the program. ""Increased management know-how is a critical tool that empowers entrepreneurs to scale businesses and create employment opportunities in emerging economies,"" said Hau Lee, faculty director of SEED and the Thoma Professor of Operations, Information and Technology. ""This course represents our first major interaction with on-the-ground entrepreneurs who will return to their respective countries to change people's lives by creating both jobs and products that solve problems in a sustained way.""</p>
<p>Led by <a href=""/faculty-research/faculty/george-foster"">George Foster</a>, the Konosuke Matsushita Professor of Management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the program will allow participants to develop core competencies to grow companies, present frameworks to manage growth and tools to drive a vibrant corporate culture, develop leadership skills to operate in a competitive global economy, and address the special opportunities and challenges involved in scaling global companies.

<p>The launch this July marks a major milestone in implementing SEED's critical strategic elements: on-the-ground training and sustained management support in a region of 300 million people, where nearly 70% of the population live on less than $2.00 per day, and 48% live on less than $1.25 per day.</p>
<p>The purpose of the regional innovation center, located in Accra, Ghana, is to stimulate economic opportunities — including job creation — by scaling high-potential local and regional businesses. The in-country effort will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sustained physical presence with a training and resource facility.</li>
<li>A program of continuous coaching by experienced business leaders who will provide hands-on support in preparation for growth and potential new financing.</li>
<li>Access to experts and investors through local, global, and Stanford networks.</li>
<li>Research that is rooted in practice and on-the-ground interactions with businesses to help overcome bottlenecks to scaling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal, hands-on approach and continuous coaching will allow SEED to work closely with target businesses and become active participants in change.</p>
<p>SEED was founded in 2011 with an extraordinary gift from Stanford alumnus and venture capitalist Robert King, MBA '60, and his wife Dorothy King, who envisioned an institute dedicated to the practical application of innovation and entrepreneurship to create jobs. In addition to the Kings, SEED's advisory board comprises Nobel laureate and New York University economist A. Michael Spence, former World Bank president and emerging markets private equity investor James Wolfensohn, Acumen Fund CEO Jacqueline Novogratz, and Managing Partner of Omidyar Network Matt Bannick.</p>
<p>Starting July 14, SEED's first cohort of approximately 30 West African businesses will begin a customized program designed to address local needs and management issues to help prepare their enterprises for expansion.</p>
<p>Participating companies, whose revenues range from $150,000 to more than $5 million, apply to the program and are selected by SEED for their potential to scale quickly and create jobs.</p>
<p>""It is our privilege to be able to leverage Stanford's resources and culture of innovation and entrepreneurship through our first on-the-ground program, which will include companies from Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and other West African nations,"" said SEED Executive Director Tralance Addy, who will be in Accra for the training and the launch event July 18.</p>

",148,"<p>More than 250 guests honored Marcus Wallenberg, CEO of Investor AB, at a gala dinner Friday as he received the European Business Leadership Award from the Stanford GSB Alumni Association.</p>
<p>The award dinner was part of a two-day 2003 European Alumni Conference in Paris March 28-29 hosted by the School. The conference included faculty-led sessions on issues ranging from a discussion about the global economy by Nobel Laureate and former Business School Dean Michael Spence to a talk on corporate trust in the wake of recent business scandals from Dean Witter Professor of Finance and Management George Parker.</p>
<p>Dean Robert L. Joss presented the European Business Leadership Award to Wallenberg during the dinner at a Paris hotel. ""I celebrate the achievements of all our European alumni,"" said Joss. ""I am especially pleased to recognize the leadership of Marcus Wallenberg—both inside the corporation and outside the corporation in the community.""</p>
<p>Wallenberg is the chief executive of Investor AB, Sweden's largest industrial holding company based in Stockholm. At 46, he is one of the youngest members of the influential Wallenberg family in Sweden, and has taken on a leadership role in the development of the industrial sector of the Wallenberg holdings in Sweden and internationally. The company manages investments in Ericsson mobile communications, appliance maker Electrolux, and AstraZeneca pharmaceuticals, among many others.</p>
<p>In recent years, Wallenberg has guided the investment company through the burst of the Internet bubble and the global financial slowdown. ""He has demonstrated remarkable skill in his management of highly complex and diversified businesses,"" said Joss. ""Some of this success comes because he is also passionate about and motivates people—whether they work directly with him or are part of the communities in which he lives. Moreover, he is driven to find ways to support educational systems worldwide to prepare the next generation for productive work.""</p>
<p>In his remarks, Wallenberg said, ""Leadership must rest on a foundation of solid values. A corporate culture should empower the team to make the appropriate decisions to reach the company's objectives."" He also underscored the importance of the personal nature of being a leader. ""A decisive factor in shaping the culture and the set of values in an organization is the individual leader. There is no 'right' way. We all have to start with our personalities and build on them.""</p>
<p>A 1993 participant in the Stanford Executive Program for senior executives, Wallenberg has also served on the Advisory Council of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is personally devoted to education. Through his position on a number of philanthropic foundation boards and as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering and Sciences, he has been instrumental in supporting research and activities aimed improving education and lifelong learning around the world.</p>
<p>His foundations have generously supported development of the Wallenberg Global Learning Center and other educational programs at Stanford University. The project links Stanford with three Swedish institutions in a long-term, global research effort to develop collaborative forms of global learning across geographic boundaries using computer technology. The Swedish participants are the Royal Institute of Technology, the Karolinska Institute, and the University of Uppsala, three of Sweden's most prestigious institutions of higher learning.</p>",,,302626 | 302481 | 302296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,,Leadership,Europe,,,Stanford Executive Program,,,,,Barbara Buell,,

Free webinar available July 15.,134,"<p>Many successful companies shape their high-level strategies by relying on simple rules, not complicated frameworks. Even established organizations can introduce a continuous flow of new products and services by streamlining their processes and encouraging an atmosphere of ""structured chaos."" Stanford's new online <a href=""http://create.stanford.edu/courses/strategy-driven-innovation.php"" target=""_blank"">Strategy Driven Innovation</a> course explores how participants can help their companies innovate through simple rules and processes.</p>
<p>The course will feature two interviews — one with serial entrepreneur Steve Blank and another with former Google operations executive and consultant Shona Brown. It also will cover ""genetic"" growth strategies for short-term goals and ""probing"" strategies for the long-term. Participants will examine case studies that evaluate why some strategies drive innovation and others fail. Enrollees will gain insights into how simple rules can outperform extensive analysis and information and will be able to practice the ideas in their own situations.</p>
<p>Key takeaways will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use simple rules as an alternative to complex processes</li>
<li>How to translate current strategy into growth</li>
<li>How to develop strategies for multiple time frames</li>
<li>How to work with a strategy paradigm of structured chaos</li>
<li>How to recognize rhythmic elements as drivers for strategy creation</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Strategy Driven Innovation</em> will be taught by Kathleen Eisenhardt, the Stanford W. Ascherman M.D. Professor at Stanford and Codirector of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. Her work centers on strategy and organization in high-velocity markets, especially in the technology sector. She is coauthor of <em>Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos</em>, which won the George R. Terry award for outstanding contribution to management thinking and was named a top-10 business and investing book by Amazon.com.</p>

Scully as the School's 32<sup>nd</sup> Arbuckle Award Winner. Scully founded SPO Partners, a private investment company and merchant bank, two years after earning his MBA.</p>
<p>Scully and his classmates traded good natured jibes including Scully's undergraduate success selling a product know as Mojo Love Oil, before turning to a more serious note.</p>
<p>""1966 to 1968 was an extraordinary juxtaposition of a very prosperous economy and a period of political unrest, combined with a gathering at the GSB of highly motivated young men (It was 98 percent men and half the class was right out of undergraduate). We were brought together in a school literally blossoming under the incredible leadership of Ernie Arbuckle,"" he recalled.</p>
<p>He posed for photos with 13 young MBA graduates who have been recipients of fellowships established by Scully in honor of his parents, Vincent and Celia Scully. He is also chairman and founder of the Making Waves program that provides tutoring, mentoring, and college guidance to more than 350 inner city youth in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Arbuckle award, named for former dean Ernest Arbuckle, is the highest honor bestowed by Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>Scully's company takes principal positions in a portfolio of public companies and undertakes significant private equity investments. The portfolio has concentrated on timberland/wood products, telecommunications, media and entertainment, real estate and hotels. SPO is the controlling shareholder of Plum Creek Timber Company, a major Seattle-based wood products real estate investment trust that owns 3.3 million timber-producing acres. SPO also is the major capital provider to a series of partnerships that own 17 luxury hotels including the San Francisco Fairmont. Mr. Scully is the largest capital partner in San Francisco's Pier 39 development.</p>
<p>A 1966 graduate of Princeton, he has served that university as a trustee and as a director of the Princeton Investment Company. He is currently a trustee of Stanford University, a director for the Stanford Management Company, a director of Stanford Hospital and Clinics, and a member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council.</p>

1,4194,10/1/07 0:00,Study Groups Don't End When These Students Graduate,51,news/headlines/community_studygroup.html,Community study group program allows alumni and PhDs to learn from each other.,78,"<p>Chris Tilghman, MBA '05, had such a blast as a student at the Stanford Graduate School of Business that he started a program that keeps the tradition of learning in study groups alive even after leaving the B-school.</p>
<p>""One of the great things about the GSB is that it's a community of people who are really smart and trust each other in a certain way,"" said Tilghman, now director of higher education marketing at InsideTrack, a college coaching service company. ""I just wanted to take advantage of this learning even after I'm no longer a student.""</p>
<p>Since it began in 2004, the business school's Community Study Group Program has allowed alumni and PhD students to learn from each other. The program has evolved to focus on PhD students and alumni, said Erica Richter, director of Lifelong Learning, the department that organizes the sessions.</p>
<p>""My philosophy has always been: If someone has a good idea, we should try it,"" she said. Tilghman said the new model addresses important needs. ""Alumni get access to cutting-edge research. Students get access to working business people ""¦ The quality of the exchanges is generally rich.""</p>
<p>Richter said seven PhD students and more than 75 alumni have taken part so far. Each six-week course involves one or two PhD students who meet with a group of 12 to 18 alumni for two hours a week to explore topics such as ""How Norms and Culture Shape Organizational Behavior,"" ""The Psychology of Social Influence, Social Networks, and Consumer Health Behavior,"" and ""Understanding Dissent in Groups and Organizations.""</p>
<p>The idea for the program emerged from Tilghman's lifelong passion for learning.</p>
<p>""I was doing stuff like taking language courses at night, taking history classes"" even as an undergraduate at Harvard, he recalled. ""I just had a lot of curiosity. I liked learning.""</p>
<p>After he entered the Stanford MBA Program, Tilghman, who also earned a master's degree in education, developed the idea of forming alumni study groups. The first group watched Ken Burns' television documentary on the Lewis and Clark expedition, and then spent time discussing their own ""venturing"" experiences, whether starting a business, shifting to a different career, or starting a family.</p>
<p>""The idea was to give the alumni community an opportunity for small group learning that reflected the environment that one enjoys in a study group,"" Tilghman said. Kimberly Rios Morrison, a business school PhD student who is doing research on organizational behavior, said the Community Study Group Program helped her expand her abilities as an up-and-coming academic.</p>
<p>""It provided me the opportunity to do some hands-on teaching before I leave Stanford,"" she said. ""As a teaching assistant for the MBA core and elective courses, I was able to plan assignments and exams, observe professors in front of the classroom, and even deliver a few short lectures of my own. However, I'd never had the experience of creating a syllabus, managing a classroom, and coming up with discussion topics.</p>
<p>""Teaching the MBA and Sloan alumni gave me a better sense of how I could further my students' professional growth while making sure they thought critically about the subject matter,"" she added. ""I am currently on the academic job market, and because a few of the schools that I'm applying to emphasize both teaching and research, I couldn't be happier that I decided to lead a study group. Now I actually have quite a bit to write about in my statement of teaching interests and philosophies.""</p>
<p>Tilghman said the program is perfect for alumni who want to keep coming back to a special place.</p>
<p>""The thing that keeps me coming back is the little flashes of insights, learning something new, seeing something in a different way,"" Tilghman said. ""I showed up here and said, ""'This community is awesome. How do I preserve this opportunity to learn?' It is such an intellectually rich environment. You don't find that everywhere. When you do, you kind of want to mine it as much as you can.""</p>

1,4232,1/1/08 0:00,Demand for Green Buildings Grows at Stanford,44,news/headlines/econference_greenbldg.html,Stanford’s green building initiatives were outlined during a January 2008 conference on sustainability cosponsored by the Stanford GSB Alumni Association. ,145,"<p>Stanford University is just stepping into the green building movement. But ambitious plans are underway to construct more buildings on campus that use fewer resources and don't release as many harmful greenhouse gases. Officials are also investigating energy-saving features that could be installed in some existing campus buildings during the next few years.</p>
<p>Even a green dorm is being planned to serve as both a student residence and laboratory showcasing resource-efficient technologies.</p>
<p>Stanford's green building initiatives were outlined during a January 2008 conference on environmental sustainability that attracted 70 graduates. The Stanford GSB Alumni Association and the university's Woods Institute for the Environment jointly sponsored the three-day event.</p>
<p>""The fact that Stanford is embracing green is, in fact, a very smart risk reduction strategy,"" said Gregory Kats, MBA '86 and managing director of Good Energies, a New York-based venture capital firm that invests heavily in clean energy ventures. ""You could imagine Stanford not doing it and five years from now, when carbon is a dominant issue and other universities are leaders in green buildings, it would hurt Stanford's brand. It's a very smart preemptive strategy to become a leader in this area.""</p>
<p>So far the university's focus on green building includes the $3.29 million Leslie Shao-Ming Sun Field Station, opened at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in 2002. The 9,800-square-foot station uses solar energy for heat, a photovoltaic system to generate electricity, and contains waterless, no-flush urinals — the first in Santa Clara County.</p>
<p>In November 2007 the university hired its first sustainability czar. Executive Director of Sustainability and Energy Management Joe Stagner is working to develop a campus-wide greenhouse gas reduction plan, with details due out this spring.</p>
<p>A green dorm is also in the works, and the goal is that the school's new campus, expected to break ground later this year, will meet the highest standards for sustainability as measured by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).</p>
<p>The overall effort is being chronicled on a <a href=""http://sustainablestanford.stanford.edu/"" target=""_blank"">website</a> started last year.</p>
<p>Plans are being developed to upgrade a dozen buildings that have been deemed the campus' 12 top ""energy hogs"" because they have the highest energy use, said Jack Cleary, Stanford's associate vice president for Academic Projects and Operations with the Land, Buildings, and Real Estate office. Many laboratories and the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts are on the list. ""We will identify what we need to do to improve the efficiency of these buildings, and identify costs,"" Cleary said.</p>
<p>Stanford's focus on designing so-called ""high-performance"" buildings comes as more Fortune 500 companies are developing green buildings that use less water and electricity than traditional structures while emphasizing healthier indoor air quality. Between 40 percent and 50 percent of U.S. carbon emissions are associated with buildings, another conference speaker, Gilbert Masters, told the group. And buildings also use three-fourths of all electricity the nation produces, he said. The major ways buildings suck up energy? Heating residential buildings, lighting commercial buildings, and heating water for homes, Masters said.</p>
<p>Bank of America is one of several Fortune 500 businesses to have opened buildings with environmental-conscious features designed to save energy, cut waste, and reduce pollution, said Kats, of Green Energies. One of the features in the bank's $1 billion high-rise in New York City is a system to capture and reuse all rainwater and wastewater, which the company says saves millions of gallons of water annually.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Kats helped design a green affordable housing development containing 63 efficiency apartments in a refurbished YMCA. The housing development in the city's Washington Park community is about 50 percent more energy efficient than a conventionally designed building, said Kats.</p>
<p>Companies and other groups are incorporating sustainable features into their buildings, Kats said, because ""it's really a statement of who they are, of their values to themselves, their employees, their future employees, and their stockholders.""</p>
<p>There are also economic benefits.</p>
<p>Insurance companies, including California's Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, have lowered premiums for green-certified buildings. New Resource Bank of San Francisco charges green developments lower interest rates, said Kats, who is also a founder of the year-old bank. ""Their energy and water bills are less,"" said Kats of high-performance buildings, which some insurance industry officials say leaves owners with more disposable income to pay their loans. Also, ""high performance buildings are better built and have lower costs and lower risks associated with them, so we're going to adjust our premiums and offerings to recognize that.""</p>
<p>Between them, Duke and Emory universities have 30 green buildings underway, added Kats. ""Parents like it because it meets their operating costs; kids like it because it's cool.""</p>
<p>Stanford's ""Green Dorm"" is still in the planning stages, and could have features including low-flow showers, solar-heated water, and photovoltaic electricity, said Allan Daly, a principal at Taylor Engineering in Alameda and a lecturer in Stanford's School of Engineering. Still, he said, ""We expect that the building won't ever be zero energy. When we need it, we're going draw energy from the grid."" And, he said, dorm residents will have to contribute toward some of the savings by turning off unused computers, for example, or even hanging laundry to dry.</p>
<p>Several alums working in the real estate or hotel development industries came to the environmental sustainability conference specifically to hear about green building initiatives and new technologies being used.</p>
<p>Janis Cenedella, division manager at S.D. Deacon Corp., an Irvine-based general contractor, said she was eager to find out whether the panelists knew about a new kind of paver used to make walkways that uses pressure created from pedestrians' weight and footsteps to generate electricity.</p>
<p>""So many developers want to go green, but don't understand what's available,"" said Cenedella, MS '81, in civil engineering. ""My hope is to come here and learn about things that are new and exciting that will filter down to the Home Depot crowd.""</p>

1,4405,8/1/95 0:00,Marketing Professor Robert Davis Dies,37,news/headlines/obit_davis.shtml,"Davis taught marketing at Stanford GSB for more than three decades, had been a board member of many companies, and been vice president of two major firms.",148,"<p>Robert T. Davis, the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing, Emeritus, at Stanford Business School, died August 17 at Stanford University Hospital. Davis taught marketing at the Business School for more than three decades and had been a board member of many companies as well as vice president of two major firms: Nike, Inc., and Varian Associates, Inc. He was 74 and lived in Los Altos Hills, Calif. The cause of death was pneumonia.</p>
<p>""Bob Davis was a very valuable member of Nike's board of directors for over 10 years, a period in which Nike sales quintupled,"" said Philip H. Knight, chairman and CEO of Nike. ""I am grateful not only for his sound business advice, but also for his creative approach to marketing. His warmth, sense of humor, and character will leave, for me, an enormous void."" Davis had been a board member of more than 30 firms, including Saga Corp., Roman Meal Co., Kaiser Cement Corp., Armor All Products Corp, Blitz-Weinhard Co., and Anthem Electronics, Inc.</p>
<p>Davis was known to his colleagues as a ""marketer's marketer."" Said his longtime friend, emeritus professor James T. S. Porterfield: ""He was one of the finest teachers the Business School has ever had. Bob had an almost unique relationship with business and its problems through his active participation in business. He added a note of pragmatism to our curriculum.""</p>
<p>Davis, who joined the Stanford Business School faculty in 1958, was an expert in the fields of sales management, marketing management at the operating level, and marketing strategy. Besides teaching MBA students, Davis was also director of the Stanford Executive Program and the Sloan Program, a masters program for mid-level managers. He was the recipient of the School's Nicholas Salgo Award for Distinguished Teaching and the Stanford GSB Alumni Association's Silver Apple Award for his service to alumni.</p>
<p>""Bob Davis was one of the premier marketing teachers in the world,"" said David B. Montgomery, a colleague at Stanford Business School and, currently, the executive director of the Marketing Science Institute in Cambridge, Mass. ""He was a much sought after executive educator throughout the globe, and he is noted for his contributions to marketing practice and to the interface between marketing academics and the practice of marketing management. He was also one of the early academic trustees of the Marketing Science Institute industry/academic partnership. To those of us privileged to know him, he was a friend of rare good humor and bright, optimistic demeanor.""</p>
<p>Added accounting professor Charles T. Horngren: ""He brought joy to the world, Bob Davis did. We'll all miss him.""</p>
<p>Davis received his AB, MBA, and DCS from Harvard. Except for leaves of absence to work for Varian and Nike, his academic career lasted from 1946 to his retirement in 1990. Before joining the Stanford faculty, Davis taught at St. Lawrence University, Dartmouth College, and Harvard. He co-authored seven textbooks including Marketing in Emerging Companies (Addison-Wesley, 1985) and Marketing Management Casebook (Irwin, 4th edition, 1984). His most recent journal article, ""Alternative Succession Strategies,"" will be published in the Summer 1995 issue of Directors & Boards.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife Hazel of Los Altos Hills, Calif.; sons Stephen of Novato, Calif., Peter of Champain-Urbana, Ill., and John of Portland Ore.; two daughters-in-law; and six grandchildren. He also leaves a brother and two sisters: Dr. Donald Davis, and Jean Davis of Orlando, Fla., and Dorothy Davis, of Amherst, Mass.</p>
<p>Funeral services will be private. The family asks that no flowers be sent, although donations to the Anne Kristen Davis Scholarship Fund, honoring his late grand-daughter, would be welcome. They should be sent to the Office of Development, Encina Hall, Stanford University.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/Lmvq6Os,Monument to Change with red and orange flip digits,,Marketing,,,,,,,,,,Barbara Buell,,
1,4427,9/1/10 0:00,Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Launched at Stanford GSB,67,news/headlines/prie-launch.html,"Applications now accepted for the 20-week Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, aimed at Silicon Valley innovators, scientists and engineers.",148,"<p>Stanford GSB will launch a new 20-week evening Program in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PRIE), in January. Applications for this certificate program are now available.</p>
<p>Aimed at industry participants who do not have an MBA, as well as entrepreneurial graduate students, the non-degree program will expose participants to fundamentals of business and practical aspects of moving a business idea forward. The 60-person program will bring together Stanford PhD and other non-business graduate students with Silicon Valley innovators, scientists, and engineers to gain greater understanding of the pathways to commercializing innovations and to learn general management skills.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the business school has conducted a successful four-week program, the Summer Institute for Entrepreneurship (SIE), which teaches entrepreneurship to non-business graduate students in life sciences, engineering, and the humanities.</p>
<p>The new PRIE certificate program builds on that success to extend this learning content to a wider variety of individuals.</p>
<p>""Our goal is to expose participants to the fundamentals of business while also engaging in the practical aspects of identifying, evaluating, and moving entrepreneurial ideas forward,"" said Peter Reiss, faculty director of both programs.</p>
<p>The new PRIE winter classes will be open to Stanford master's or doctoral students or postdocs as well as men and women from Silicon Valley who have strong technical backgrounds and training, and who hold graduate degrees in their fields of expertise. All participants should have high proficiency in their field, perhaps even some business experience, but must not have had previous graduate business education, said Reiss.</p>
<p>""This new program will provide graduate students and graduates in non-business fields with the management knowledge and skills they need to become leaders in established and startup organizations,"" said Garth Saloner, dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Saloner, along with Stanford University President John Hennessy, developed the original idea for the summer program as a way to help graduate students in non-business disciplines to collaborate with one another and benefit from the resources of the business school.</p>
<p>""The program is designed to be innovative, to get emerging entrepreneurs out of their daily environments and expose them to different ways of thinking and interacting in the business world,"" said Aimee Slobin, associate director of both programs. The new program ""provides participants from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to learn about business fundamentals and bring a venture idea to life in a collaborative environment.""</p>
<p>The new PRIE winter program will be housed in the school's Knight Management Center, due to open just weeks before the first PRIE session in January. The deadline for applications is November 15.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/SnRHESM,Monument to Change with yellow and purple flip digits,,,Education | Entrepreneurship,,,,,,,,,Barbara Buell,,
1,4430,3/15/02 0:00,Professor Puri Selected as Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow,58,news/headlines/puri_sloan_fship.shtml,"Associate finance professor Manju Puri has focused on financial intermediation, particularly related to banking and more recently to venture capital.",149,"<p>Manju Puri, associate professor of finance at the Graduate School of Business, has been awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, an honor that carries a grant of $40,000 to be applied in an unrestricted manner toward any research interest of the recipient's choosing. Puri's scholarly work has focused on financial intermediation, particularly related to banking and more recently to venture capital.</p>
<p>Sloan Research Fellowships, awarded for two-year terms, recognize young scientists who show outstanding promise of making fundamental contributions to new knowledge in the fields of chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, economics, and neuroscience. Sloan Research Fellows must have completed their PhD in these fields within six years of their nomination for selection, must be members of the regular faculty of a college or university in the United States or Canada, and must be nominated by senior scholars or department heads.</p>
<p>Puri's research in banking has centered on the conflicts of interest banks face in serving as both securities underwriters and lenders to companies, and how their role compares to that of investment banking firms, which serve only as underwriters. Her papers on universal banking and the implications for the Glass-Steagall Banking Act have received numerous awards, including a Western Finance Association best paper award, a National Science Foundation award, and the best paper prize in Journal of Financial Economics. Puri's recent research in banking examines implications for the firm when banks act as debtor-in-possession financiers, as sellers of loans, and as participants in venture capital.</p>
<p>Puri has co-authored several papers on the subject of venture capital, including its role in the professionalization of start-up firms, and its role in the product market. Along with Stanford Business School colleague Thomas Hellmann, she recently has been awarded a National Science Foundation grant to investigate the economic foundations of venture capital.</p>
<p>Appointed last year to the National Bureau of Economic Research, she also serves on the editorial boards of such scholarly publications as Journal of Financial Intermediation, Journal of Money Credit and Banking, and Journal of Banking and Finance.</p>
<p>Puri joined the Stanford business school faculty in 1995, developing new elective courses in banking and venture capital. She earned her 1995 PhD in finance at New York University after working at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. She received her MBA in finance and strategy from the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, India, and her undergraduate degree, with honors, in economics from Delhi University.</p>
<p>Originally awarded to 22 scholars when the program was established in 1955, Sloan Research Fellowships are now awarded annually to 104 young scientists of outstanding promise; 24 Sloan Fellows have later won Nobel Prizes in their careers.</p>
