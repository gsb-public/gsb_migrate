5,Behavioral Measurement For Marketing Models:  Estimating The Effects Of Advertising Repetition For Media Planning,"As management science models are developed in marketing, they make demands for more sophisticated inputs from the behavioral sciences. This is particularly true in the area of advertising media models. A continuing behavioral research program to develop estimates of repetition response functions for media models is reviewed. The program finds functions which differ importantly in level, slope and shape depending on the measure of response, market segment, product type, brand, advertising format, advertising illustration, advertise- ment color, media scheduling, ad appeal, and competitive situation. It is argued that such response function variations, found in both laboratory and field research, should be represented in media models. To illustrate this point, the results of a study of repetitive effects of one-sided (supportive) and two-sided (refutational) competitive advertisements are applied to runs of the MEDIAC planning system. Inclusion of the behavioral data produces favorable changes in MEDIAC output in terms of schedules and schedule results. The potential of further interaction between behavioral data and management science models is discussed.",1971,mlray,Alan,Sawyer
7,Interperiod Tax Allocation And The Behavior Of Security Prices,"The measurement of earnings has been of continuing concern to accountants and to users of accounting data. Because an unlimited number of possible reporting methods exists, and because the collection, storage, reporting and analysis of data are not costless activities, controversies have arisen concerning the relative merit of alternative income measurement rules. The relationship between measured earnings and security price be- havior is of special interest to such issues for several reasons: (1) If one is willing to accept the notion that securities' markets are efficient and hence provide unbiased assessments of ""true"" wealth changes of the firm, security price behavior offers a normative basis for evaluating measured earnings and alternative methods of income measurement. More will be said about this later. (2) Even if one does not assume an efficient market exists, the relationship between earnings and security prices can still provide valuable insight. Such research can indicate in what ways, if any, measured earnings affect decision makers' behavior as reflected in security price changes. Such positive knowledge constitutes a prerequisite for the development of any normative scheme of reporting rules (e.g., APB opinions). A further implication of rejecting the efficient market viewpoint is the possibility that abnormal returns can be obtained from a knowledge of re- lationships of earnings and security prices, although the authors do not personally subscribe to this view. I_x000B_1 In fact, evidence will be offered later in the paper that lends further support to the efficient market hypothesis. _x000B_",1971,fbeaver,Roland,Dukes
12,Theories Of Attitude Structure And Change,"The study of attitudes is well entrenched in marketing theory and practice. The acceptance by theorists is evident in the pivotal role that the concept of attitude plays in the major descriptive models of consumer behavior (Engel, Kollat and Blackwell, 1968; Howard and Sheth, 1969; Nicosia, 1966). Practitioners have tended to take a more limited view of attitude as an easily measured construct they can use to understand their market, and perhaps to evaluate the effect of a persuasive communication. In reality, most practitioners are inveterate theorists, constantly invoking experimental theories of attitude change to predict changes in purchasing or usage behavior as a consequence of alternative strategies for changing attitudes. The necessity for such theories can be illustrated by the following problems:  (a) A farm equipment manufacturer in a developing country wants prospective distributors to adopt a new scheme for financing inventories. First he has to change their presently negative attitudes towards investing in inventories; but how? (b) The makers of low pollution emmitant and low lead gasolines wish to associate their product with pollution abatement in a positive manner. What appeals should they use?  (c) Birth control pill manufacturers need to predict the response of pill users to negative information from a highly credible source, such as a senate subcommittee.   What proportion of the users are, susceptible to change because of lack of conviction and ambivalent attitude? (d) Consumers have a strong aversion to ""reprocessed"" forms of materials such as textiles and plastics. _x000B_",1971,,George,Day

A network approach is used to derive qualitative results which reduce  the calculations required to find an optimal solution.

236,Risk Evaluation of Capital Investments: A Survey,This is a survey of techniques for evaluation of risk in  individual capital investment projects. The paper identifies  the four types of relationships affecting project uncertainty;  1)Accounting-type relationships defining cash flow; 2)Statistical  relationships among variables in a given time period;   3)Autocorrelation relationships among cash flows over time;  and 4)Uncertainty about project life. Two types of decisions  also can affect project profitability and uncertainty:   1)Strategy decisions; and   2) Abandonment decisions. Four types of models for risk evaluation are identified:   1)Certainty model; 2)Hillier  model; 3)Monte Carlo model; and 4)Decision Tree model. These  four types of models are compared and evaluated in terms of how easily they can incorporate the relationships and decisions mentioned above. Computational issues are also discussed. Suggestions are made for further research.,1974,bonini,,
237,Triangular Factorization and Generalized Upper Bounding Techniques,"A compact inverse method is developed for linear programming problems having block triangular or sparse constraint matrices. Special cases of the method are, for example, the generalized upper bounding technique  and its extensions. For these methods we show how a triangular factorization can be used for the working basis and block bases. In this case (and  even if the constraint matrix has no special structure) our method becomes a variation of the revised simplex method using a single triangular factorization of the basis. However, the updating procedure of the triangular factors   differs from existing ones in a way that implies that certain  structures are exploited   naturally.",1975,eporteus,Markku,Kallio
238,A Class of Methods for Linear Programming,"A class of methods is presented for solving standard linear programing problems. Like the simplex method, these methods  move from one feasible solution to another at each iteration,  improving the objective function as they go. Each such feasible solution is also associated with a basis. However, this feasible solution need not be an extreme point and the basic solution corresponding to the associated basis need not be feasible. Nevertheless, an optimal solution, if one exists, is found in a finite number of   iterations. The nonbasic variables must be ordered in the methods of our class. Except for this characteristic, the simplex method [2] and the reduced gradient method [4] belong to   this class.",1975,eporteus,Markku,Kallio

In this paper, a framework, based on decision theory, is  proposed as a means of   anticipating and dealing with the ethical issues inherent in any change activity Three sets of actors (researchers, subjects, and concerned others) are identified as relevant  participants in the change   situation. A means for incorporating the viewpoints of each of these actors is developed and examples are  presented to demonstrate applications of the framework.",1975,porras,Charles,Weinberg

The standard models of positive and negative dynamic programming are given in this context, thus extending these results to criteria other than the usual expected  sum of rewards, such as expected utility criteria , certain  stochastic games, risk sensitive Markov decision processes, and maximin criteria. For positive problems, (what are called) unimprovable strategies  are optimal and the optimal value sequence is the least solution of the optimality equations exceeding an obvious lower bound. For negative problems, conserving strategies are optimal and if one strategy  is a one-step improvement on another, then it nets a greater value. (This rules out cycling   in the strategy iteration procedure.) Also, transfinite methods are used to prove that the optimal value sequence  is the greatest solution of the optimality equations less than an  obvious upper bound. We indicate how all these results can be extended to analogues of the   essentially positive, essentially negative,  and convergent cases.",1975,eporteus | kreps,,
261,"On Optimal Dividend, Reinvestment, and Liquidation Policies for the Firm","The liquid asset management problem of a firm with a fixed  business is considered. Two questions are addressed. First, how much, if any, of the firm's liquid assets should be paid to the owners as dividends? Second, if the liquid asset level is negative (resulting from a net   loss in the previous period), should sufficient funds be  raised to pay off the corresponding short term debts, or should the benefit of   limited liability be applied by liquidating the firm (declaring  it bankrupt)? These questions   are addressed in a multiperiod  environment under uncertainty. The owners seek to maximize the present expected value of the   after tax returns from dividends less funds invested over the   lifetime of the firm. Since the owners must pay income  taxes on dividends they receive but cannot deduct the expenses of paying off short term debts when needed, they have an   incentive to have the firm   retain some liquid assets as a hedge against having to raise funds to pay off such short term debts. The form of the optimal policy in the general case is found to be surprisingly complex. A numerical example  is used to illustrate the possible complexities. The main thrust of the paper is the presentation of three sets of conditions which are sufficient  to prove that there exists an optimal policy with a certain   intuitively pleasing and simple form. The paper paves the way   to further study of the relevance of the capital structure of a firm.",1976,eporteus,,

310,Independence and Calibration in Decision Analysis,"An individual is said to be   potentially miscalibrated if he is not sure whether his future subjective probability assessments will agree with observed frequency. Alternately, the individual is said to be uncertain about his own calibration. It is argued that such a person will never perceive any two events as (probabilistica1ly) independent,  in the same sense that an ignorant person does not perceive  events as certain. Uncertainty about one's own calibration does not prevent rational behavior  in the decision theoretic sense, but it may make much more difficult the process of   translating decision theoretic  principles into practical procedures for analysis of real decision problems.",1976,mikehar,,

321,Temporal Resolution of Uncertainty and Dynamic Choice Theory,"We consider dynamic choice behavior under conditions of uncertainty, with emphasis on the timing of the resolution of uncertainty. Choice behavior in which an individual distinguishes between lotteries based on the times at which their uncertainty resolves is axiomatized and represented,  thus the result is choice behavior which cannot be represented by a single  cardinal utility function on the vector of payoffs. Both descriptive and normative treatments of the problem are given and are shown to be equivalent. Various specializations are provided, including an extension of ""separable"" utility and representation by a single cardinal utility function.",1976,eporteus | kreps,,
322,Dynamic Choice Theory and Dynamic Programming,"Finite horizon sequential decision problems with a ""temporal vonNeumann-Morgenstern utility"" criterion   are analyzed. This criterion, as developed in [7], is a generalization of vonNeumann-Morgenstern (expected) utility of  the vector of rewards, wherein an individual's preferences concerning the timing of the   resolution of uncertainty are taken into account. The preference theory underlying this criterion is reviewed and then extended in natural fashion  to yield preferences for   strategies in sequential decision problems. The main  result is that value functions for sequential decision problems can be defined by a dynamic programming recursion using the functions which represent the  original preferences, and these value functions represent the preferences defined on   strategies. This permits citation of standard results from the  dynamic programming literature, concerning the existence of (memoryless) strategies which are optimal with respect to the given preference relation.",1977,eporteus | kreps,,

This paper describes  some of the analytic procedures which are being used by the management of one performing arts series.  The starting point for ARTS PLAN is dummy variable regression analysis of historical data which leads to a prediction of attendance at future  performances. This prediction can be overridden by the manager if he or she disagrees with the forecast. The forecast is then embedded in an inter-active model which can be used for planning a season or for deciding which events to promote in a season already planned.",1977,,Charles | Kenneth,Weinberg | Shachmut
336,Evaluation Methodology in Organization Development:_x000B_An Analysis and Critique,"The purpose of this analysis is to present a detailed overview of the current state of evaluation methodology in Organization Development. A detailed search procedure yielded thirty-five empirical studies in the OD field for the period 1959 to mid-1975. Each study was analyzed according to (1) research design; (2) data collection procedures; (3) subject characteristics; (4) treatment dimensions; and (5) data analysis approaches. Findings show that the overall quality of OD research methodology was spotty. Research designs were relatively strong with a large percentage of investigators using quasi-experimental designs. An excessive reliance on questionnaires as the sole data collection approach exists. Only a small percent of studies report using other quantified approaches. Most studies were conducted in one organization or in situations where the N's for units of analysis larger than the individual were small (< 10). The heavy use of laboratory training intervention techniques was noted, although a strong shift from process to task orientation has occurred in recent years. Over 75% of the studies reported the use of statistical tests of significance. Although data analysis procedures are becoming more sophisticated, the vast majority of studies used very simple analytical techniques. Based on this analysis, a series of suggestions for improvement of methodological approaches to OD research is presented.",1977,porras,P.O.,Berg

375,Cognitive Information Processing Biases: Implications for Producers and Users of Financial Information,"The emerging information-processing and decision-making literature indicates that individuals use heuristic procedures that simplify cognitive processing requirements. Judgments (particularly subjective probabilities) are based on limited processing of a proper subset of the available evidence. Tasks potentially calling for complex analysis are  reduced to heuristic procedures and efficient information processing may result: these heuristics can however produce systematic biases and  costly errors in judgement.  People also exhibit cognitive biases that systematically affect  judgments of statistical properties of random variables. The biases appear to be cognitive in nature and therefore are not due entirely to  emotional, motivational, or cost-of-processing considerations. For some cognitive biases, a possible explanation has been suggested in the context  of an heuristic processing procedure. The objective of this paper is to analyze and synthesize the currently  available research on cognitive heuristics and information-processing biases from the perspective of research and actual financial decision  situations. Important implications for users and designers of information systems will be discussed. One generic conclusion from the literature is that individuals appear to be inadequate ""intuitive""  statisticians; a need for formal judgment and decision aids will become clear.",1979,,William,Wright

These prices permit an equilibrium valuation of assets with uncertain payoffs at many future dates. Furthermore, for any given portfolio, the price of a $1 claim received at a future date, if the portfolio's value is between two  given levels at that time, is derived explicitly from a second partial derivative of its call option pricing function. An intertemporal capital asset pricing model is derived for payoffs that are jointly lognormally distributed  with aggregate consumption. It is shown that using the Black-Scholes equation for options on aggregate consumption implies that individuals' preferences aggregate to isoelastic utility.",1978,,Douglas | Robert,Breeden | Litzenberger

Consequently, when defining and estimating S-shaped functions, most effort should be devoted to determination of the inflection point and the function's behavior above the inflection point.",1979,,James | Charles,Freeland | Weinberg
399,Organization Development In A Large System: An Empirical Assessment,"This study reports the results of a quasi-experimental field  study measuring the effects of three Organization Development (OD) interventions conducted in a large, geographically dispersed organization.  The OD interventions were designed to improve the climate,  leadership, group process, and overall performance of experimental units through a series of activities aimed at providing a philosophical base for change; building effective team relationships and problem solving skills; and alteration of techno-structural and social variables impeding efficiency of the work unit. A comparison of   results from approximately forty experimental and control sub-units (randomly assigned  to these conditions) provides   the basis for the first part of this analysis. A second comparison was made using those experimental units who had received a relativel  more intense treatment. The findings  show that the effect of the interventions was largely negative on attitudinal and behavioral variables describing organizational and individual processes. The higher intensity treatment condition generally yielded more negative effects,   particularly as perceived by  managers. However, some outcome variables such as self-actualization and several measures of unit performance showed an unexpected improvement  given the negative process changes. Attempts were made to explain this anomalous decoupling of process and outcomes, the differential  effects on managers and subordinates, and the generally negative effects of the interventions.",1979,porras,Alan,Wilkins

405,"Intermittent Production Scheduling: Practical Formulations, Relaxation, and Decomposition Procedures","Intermittent production scheduling encompasses the classical job shop and project scheduling problems. Viewed from the perspective of the researcher, these complex problems require some simplifying assumptions to improve our ability to design scheduling procedures. These simplifying assumptions are in essence constraints on the problem formulation. Viewed from the perspective of the manager, practical formulations may require the relaxation of these constraints. This chapter reports on some research, undertaken by the authors, aimed at extending results obtained with simplified formulations to formulations in which some of the assumptions are relaxed. Assumptions relaxed are: 1) due dates are fixed and must be met; 2) machine capacity is fixed; 3) technological precedence requirements are strictly applied; 4) transportation times and set-up times are negligible; 5) processing times are deterministic; and 6) no new jobs arrive during the scheduling period. Two approaches are pursued. The first relaxes one or two constraints at a time and explores the usefulness of schedules generated using standard single-pass or multi-pass procedures. The second starts with a more general formulation and develops formal decomposition procedures that allow subproblems to be solved using standard procedures.",1977,chollowa,Rosser,Nelson

424,Properties of Judgment Models in a Financial Setting,"The purpose of this study is to extend judgment research by investigating properties of information processing models   utilized in a financial  judgment situation. Forty-seven graduate business school students estimated percentage changes in the prices of fifty   securities. An important  element of the research design is the availability of an   objective, readily determinable ""environmental"" processing model. Dimensions of cognitive processing considered here include the accuracy and   reliability of judgments,  linear vs. nonlinear processing, interjudge agreement and self-insight into weighting and combining of information cues. The results are compared with  evidence from other areas of applied psychology. Individual and aggregated (""nominal group"") judgment models were generated. Aggregation models depict  processing representative of the set of subjects and   diversification out of  individual biases and errors is possible.  Statistically significant   levels of judgment accuracy are reported here. Moderate agreement among the subjects was noted and a linear model did  not explain a large percentage of the variance in judgments. A significant degree of self-insight into the relative weighting of cues by subjects is  indicated.

A review of current practice in these areas illustrates some of  the problems that arise from currently employed decision rules. A formal structuring of the nonprofit organization's marketing mix problem leads to  the determination of optimal decision rules.

This study reports on an experiment with human subjects as decision makers in a simulated decomposed organization. The formulation of the overall coordination and resource allocation problem as a linear program permitted two  forms of decomposition: price-directive and resource-directive.

Temporal von Neumann-Morgenstern preference   relations can encompass the   first effect but not the second.

The empirical method of Wagner, O'Hagan, and Lundh  was evaluated concurrently. It   also performed very well. Although its performance was not as good as that of the new method, it required less  computational effort. The question of the extent to which application of one of these approximate methods can provide improved performance in practical  periodic review systems was   raised. A partial answer was obtained by examining  the performance of policies found by using a continuous review model. Both  the new method and the empirical method outperformed these  policies.

544,On The Design Of Subscription Programs For A Performing Arts Series,"This paper reports results obtained from a conjoint analysis, using a mail questionnaire, of the demand for subscription series to performing arts events. Many performing arts organizations offer substantial discounts to season subscribers. Our finding, however, is that the discount level may not be a very important consideration with respect to season subscription decisions, compared with such factors as seating priority and driving time to the auditorium. The results obtained in the study helped the management of one organization to reach a decision about reducing the size of the discount offered to subscribers. The study uses data collected by mail survey methods to estimate entries for a set of tradeoff matrices. Checks to assess the consistency of these data are developed and implemented. Finally, it is shown that commonly computed derived attribute importance weights need to be adjusted by the number of levels used to define hypothetical objects. That is, it is found that the greater the number of levels, the higher the derived importance weights, while holding constant the attribute variation",1980,,Charles | Imran,Weinberg | Currim
547,Computing The Discounted Return In Markov And Semi-Markov Chains,"This paper addresses the problem of computing the expected discounted return in finite Markov and semi-Markov chains. The objective is to reveal insights into two questions. First, which iterative methods hold the most promise? Second, when are iterative methods preferred to Gaussian elimination? A set of twenty-seven randomly generated problems are used to compare the performance of the methods considered. The observations that apply to the problems generated here are as follows: Gauss-Seidel is not preferred to Pre-Jacobi in general. However, if the matrix is reordered in a certain way and the author's row sum extrapolation is used, then Gauss Seidel is preferred. Transforming a semi-Markov problem into a Markov one using a transformation that comes from Schweitzer does not yield improved performance. A method that is analogous to what is called SSOR in the numerical analysis literature does yield improved performance, especially when the row sum extrapolation is used only sparingly. This method is then compared to Gaussian elimination and is found to be superior for most of the problems generated.",1980,eporteus,,

550,"Learning, Estimation, And The Stability Of Rational Expectations","This paper is an investigation of the stability of the rational expectations equilibrium of a simple asset market model, in a situation where a group of dealers are learning by estimating the relationship between the price and return on the asset by ordinary least squares, and using their estimates in predicting the return from the  price.  The model which is being estimated is a well specified model of  the rational expectations equilibrium, but a mis-specified model of the  situation in which the dealers are learning.  Two learning methods are studied; in the first the estimates reach their probability limits before a new forecasting rule is adopted,  in the second the forecasting rule is modified each time a new data point is observed.  The stability of the rational expectations equilibrium under both these learning rules depends upon a parameter k, which is a function of the proportion of demand which originates from the dealers who are learning and the regression coefficient of return on price in the rational expectations equilibrium. The conditions for global stability of the equilibrium are -1 < k < 1 under the first learning method and k > -1 under the second.",1980,,Margaret,Bray

579,Comparing Derived Importance Weights Across Attributes: An Experimental Study Using Conjoint Analysis,"In this study we investigate the possibility that derived attribute importance weights, as commonly computed in conjoint analysis applications, may be systematically influenced by the number of levels on which an attribute is defined for constructing hypothetical stimuli. Specifically, the research hypothesis is that the importance weight increases as the number of levels increases, even when the range of variation is constant for the attribute. Forced preference rank order judgments about hypothetical summer jobs were collected from first-year MBA students at a private university. The students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. The experimental groups differed in the number of levels used for two of the summer job attributes and in the method of data collection used. The range of variation was held constant for one of these attributes. The results suggest that the experimental conditions have a substantial and statistically significant impact on the magnitude of relative derived attribute importance weights. A mathematical adjust- ment for this phenomenon is suggested, and is shown to eliminate a great deal of the variation across experimental conditions.",1980,,Julia | Dick,Nutter | Wittink

For an identifiable subset of firms, the results are consistent with a significant information transfer occurring between the earnings release firm and the other firms in its  industry. This subset is   identified by examining the impact of the release on the stock price of the announcing firm. The magnitude of this impact is more significant for a sample of firms which have a larger percentage of their revenues in the same line of business as the earnings release firm vis-a-vis a sample with a lower percentage of their revenues from the same  line of business, Alternative interpretations of the empirical results are also discussed.

We then examine the concept of economic depreciation in a risky environment, and show that depreciation allowances, if set ex-ante, should be adjusted to take account of future asset price risk.  Some empirical calculations suggest that these adjustments are large, and have important implications for the burdens of, and non-neutralities in, the corporate income tax.",1982,jbulow,Lawrence,Summers

Simple, intuitive and  fairly general relations are obtained which apply to most of the models of financial economics in the 1970s. The single-good analysis generalizes and provides a synthesis of many prior works. More originally, the paper shows that the positive relation between the interest rate and the expected growth of aggregate real consumption holds in a general multi-good economy, but the  negative relation to real consumption variance is ambiguous in general. The  relevant inflation rate for the ""Fisher"" effect is shown to be appropriately measured using goods' aggregate marginal expenditure shares. Consistent movements in interest rates, inflation and consumption and production aggregates during a business cycle are discussed.",1984,,Douglas,Breeden

This is accomplished by examining the behavior of conditional expected returns. The approach is developed using a single risk premium asset pricing model as an example and then extended to models with multiple risk premiums.

685,A Simple Econometric Approach for Utility-Based Asset Pricing Models,"Utility-based models of asset pricing may be estimated with or without assuming a distribution for security returns; both approaches are developed and compared here. The chief strength of a parametric estimator lies in its computational simplicity and statistical efficiency when the added distributional assumption is true. In contrast, the nonparametric estimator is robust to departures from any particular distribution, and it is more consistent with the spirit underlying utility-based asset pricing models since the distribution of asset returns remains unspecified even in the empirical work. The nonparametric approach turns out to be easy to implement with precision nearly indistinguishable from its parametric counterpart in this particular application. The application shows that log utility is consistent with the data over the period 1926-1981.",1984,,David | Michael,Brown | Gibbons

Whether the action provides  costs or benefits in the second market depends on (a) whether it increases or decreases  marginal costs in the second market and (b) whether competitors' products are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. The latter distinction is determined by whether more ""aggressive"" play (e.g., lower price or higher quantity) by one firm in a market lowers or raises competing firms' marginal profitabilities in that market.

The  returns earned by simple trading rules dissipate within five to ten minutes, although significant returns are detected in the overnight period and at the opening of trading on the next day. Disturbances in the variance and serial correlation persist for several hours and extend into the following trading  day. As a class, dividend announcements induce much less   activity than do earnings, although the response to dividend changes is comparable to the earnings announcement effect.",1983,jpatell | fwolfson,,

Standard economies of scale appear significant but small in magnitude relative to the learning effect. Variations in the slope of the learning curve are linked to differences in R&D expenditures and capital intensity. Market concentration is found to strongly influence price flexibility and the timing of learning-related price changes.,1984,,Marvin,Lieberman

727,Investing in Reduced Setups in the EOQ Model,"This paper is motivated by the observation that the Japanese have devoted much time and energy to decreasing setup costs in their manufacturing processes and that there has been little in the way of a formal framework available to use to think about such efforts. The object of this paper is to begin to provide such a framework. The framework  developed identifies only one aspect of the advantages of reducing setups, namely reduced  inventory related operating costs. The other advantages, such as improved quality control,  flexibility, and increased effective capacity, are not accounted for in this paper. Nevertheless, substantial reductions in setups may be warranted based solely on the benefits identified in this paper. The approach taken here introduces an investment cost associated with changing the (current) setup level and adds a per unit time amortization of this cost to the other costs identified in the standard EOQ model. The general problem becomes that of minimizing the sum of a convex and a concave function. In two special cases, the minimization can be carried out explicitly. In one of these cases, numerous interpretations  of the resuIts are made, including comparisons of Japanese and American practices. The paper also addresses the joint selection of the setup cost and the sales rate. Selection of the sales rate is seen as incorporating explicit production and holding costs into the classical monopolist's pricing problem.",1984,eporteus,,
728,Investing in New Parameter Values in the Discounted EOQ Model,"Recently, Porteus (7) was motivated by the observation that the Japanese have devoted much time and energy to decreasing setup costs in their manufacturing processes and that there has been little in the way of a formal framework for thinking about such efforts. That paper began to provide such a framework by considering the 'parameters' of the classical undiscounted EOQ model to be decision variables, introducing an investment cost function that reflects the cost of changing them, and studying the ensuing optimization problem. This paper continues that effort by extending the framework to the discounted EOQ model, encompassing not only altering the setup cost, but the sales (demand) rate, unit cost, and unit holding cost as well. A parametric analysis of the discounted EOQ model is carried out in which the behavior of the optimal order quantity and minimum cost are characterized as functions of the parameters. Seeking to optimize over one of the 'parameters' of the model leads naturally to minimizing the sum of a convex and a concave function. Whereas explicit formulas were obtained in Porteus (7), this paper specifies an algorithmic approach for solving such generic optimization problems and uses it to solve a few numerical examples. Certain qualitative results obtained in Porteus (7) are obtained here as well. For example, in a special case of the investment cost function for changing the setup cost, there is a critical sales level, below which no reductions in the setup are made, and above which such reductions are made, with more reduction made for higher sales rates. The problems of optimally selecting the sales rate is treated as incorporating explicit production and holding costs into the classical monopolist's pricing problem. The setting analyzed here is more general than that in Porteus (7).",1984,eporteus,,

735,"Earnings Releases, Anomolies and the Behavior of Security Returns","A common finding in the literature is that systematic post-announcement drifts in security returns are associated with the sign or magnitude of  unexpected earnings changes. This paper examines proposed explanations for these drifts. The paper also documents that   the systematic drifts in  security returns are found for only a subset of earnings expectations models. For a class of expectation models based on the time series of reported quarterly earnings, variables coding (i) the sign and magnitude of the earnings forecast error, and (ii) firm size independently explain 81%  and 61% respectively of the   variation in post-announcement   drifts. The joint explanatory power of (i) and (ii) is 85%, indicating t h a t the effect,  of these two variables is highly collinear. The drifts are a persistent phenomenon over the 1974 to 1981 period with no evidence of being concentrated in a specific subperiod. The properties of expectation models  based on the time series of   earnings are contrasted with   earnings expectation models based on security returns. The   latter exhibit no evidence of systematic post-announcement   drift behavior. The expectation  models based on security returns have the appealing property that the assignment of firms to unexpected earnings change   portfolios better approximates the independence over time assumption. This property means  that these models are less exposed to the ""proxy effect"" criticism that has been made of results previously reported in the literature. The results in  the paper are based on a sample of over 56,000 observations covering the 1974 to 1981 time period.",1984,gfoster,Chris | Terry,Olsen | Shevlin

743,"Optimal Lot Sizing, Process Quality Improvement and Setup Cost Reduction","This author has recently contributed to understanding the economic tradeoffs of alternative production systems by introducing the option of investing in reducing the setup cost parameter in the classical undiscounted EOQ model. That work only addresses the reduced setup and holding costs that are associated with reducing the setup cost. This paper seeks to address another benefit of lower setup costs: improved quality. It does so by introducing a simple model in which there is a significant relationship between quality and lot size: While producing a lot, the process can go ""out of control"" with a given probability each time another unit is produced. Once out of control, the process produces defective units and continues to do so until the entire lot is produced. An extra cost, for rework, etc., is incurred for each defective piece produced. Thus, the optimal lot size is smaller than that given by the classical EOQ formula, because of the smaller resulting expected fraction of defective units. The paper goes on to introduce the option of investing in process quality improvement by means of reducing the probability of the process moving out of control. Such an investment yields better output quality (fewer defects), a larger lot size, fewer setups, and larger holding costs. Similarly, an investment solely in setup cost reduction yields a smaller lot size, lower holding costs, and better output quality. When seeking the optimal process quality level and/or setup cost in general, a specially designed algorithm must be used, as the problem is one of minimizing the sum of a convex and a concave function. However, a specific form for the investment cost functions is assumed and the optimal solutions to the various cases that arise are found explicitly. The results are illustrated with a numerical example.",1984,eporteus,,
752,Shaping the Organizational Context for Black American Inclusion,"Recent gains in black occupational status, importantly aided by such programs as   affirmative action, have created new interracial job situations throughout American society. This paper reviews the problems that arise at the recruitment,   entry and promotional stages for  Black Americans. The problems   arise from two interrelated   sources: the structure of the situatuions themselves and the operation of antiblack prejudice in both its traditional and modern forms.  A social psychological analysis is advanced that emphasizes the biases introduced by the ""triple jeopardy"" these workers often endure: (1) negative racial   stereotypes; (2) the solo role - when the worker is the only black in the work group; and (3) the token role - when new black workers are viewed by white co-workers as incompetent simply because they received their jobs through affirmative action. The barriers to black inclusion created by this triple jeopardy are discussed at several levels: biased and stressful recruitment practices; assumed dissimilarity and exaggerated expectations on entry; and later polarized, biased evaluations of performance.  These processes often deny the new black employee needed realistic feedback and informal social support.  The results, then, can involve not only biased evaluations but actual decrements in black job performance. The analysis is illustrated by several suggested micro-remedies. But these micro-remedies alone are unlikely to be sufficient unless ministered in the larger context of structural, macro-remedies.  Two illustrative macro-remedies are advanced, both of which aim to prevent solo situations and   enlarge the black pool of   qualified workers.",1986,jmartin,Thomas,Pettigrew

755,Strategy-Making and Evolutionary Theory: Toward a Capabilities-Based Perspective,"The strategic process in large, diversified firms is shown to be  isomorphous to the enactment—selection—retention model of evolutionary theory. Such strategic processes are internalized selection mechanisms, nested within external environmental selection mechanisms, and operate on  classes of strategic behavior. Recent contributions of Japanese scholars underscore the usefulness of the evolutionary paradigm for strategic management, but they suggest somewhat different mechanisms for variety amplification in organizations. The evolutionary paradigm requires strategic management scholars to come to grips with the stochastic nature of strategic change, and suggests that managing the capabilities of the organization may form the foundation for strategic management.",1984,profrab,,
756,Regulation of Prices and Pollution Under Incomplete Information,"The regulation of prices and pollution for a regulated monopolist is considered with a focus on the comparison of standard-setting and emissions  taxation approaches to pollution control. The firm is assumed to be better informed about the costs and effectiveness of abatement technologies than is  either regulator. If information were complete the two approaches to pollution control would be equivalent, but with incomplete information emissions taxation is shown to be a dominated approach because the use of a  tax generates information costs that can be avoided when an abatement standard and prices are set by the regulator. If a taxation approach were used in which the choice of the abatement standard were delegated to the firm, the firm would in the optimal regulatory policy choose a standard that  is lower than the regulator prefers. Furthermore, the emissions tax would be set below the marginal value of abatement. An example demonstrates that the  emissions taxation approach results in a lower technology standard and a lower price than does the standard-setting approach.",1984,dbaron,,
757,Noncooperative Regulation of a Nonlocalized Externality,"A nonlocalized pollution   externality poses special   regulatory problems when both a) the costs and benefits of abatement are borne by different persons and b)the interests of the two groups are represented by different regulatory agencies. A relevant example is acid rain for which consumers and producers of electricity in the Midwest are likely to bear the costs of abatement, while the residents of the Northeast receive the  benefits of abatement. The interests of Midwestern consumers and producers are the responsibility of a state public utility commission (PUC), and the interests of residents of the Northeast are represented by the EPA. Given the conflicting   interests of the regulators and incomplete information about  abatement costs and benefits, the regulators may not have an incentive to cooperate in the regulation of pollution and   prices. A regulatory game is  formulated in which each regulator controls regulatory instruments that affect the operations of a firm which is   better informed about the cost and effectiveness of abatement alternatives than is either regulator.  The analysis predicts that the EPA will act as a Stackelberg leader with respect to the PUC, and a regulatory equilibrium is characterized.",1984,dbaron,,

We suppose that an equilibrium exists for this economy. The Arrow-Debreu economy is placed in a Radner (dynamic) setting; agents may trade claims at any time during [0,T]. Under appropriate conditions it is possible to implement the original Arrow-Debreu equilibrium, which may have an infinite-dimensional commodity space, in a Radner equilibrium with only a finite number of securities. This is done by opening the ""right"" set of security markets, a set which effectively completes markets for the Radner economy.",1984,duffie,Chi-fu,Huang

Two conditions based on production possibilities, preferences, and the topological nature of bounded sets are shown to substitute, in any locally convex space, for the advantages of the Euclidean topology. Examples fulfilling these conditions are supplied. The approach is that of Bewley, demonstrating equilibria on kite-dimensional sub-economies, each of which is a copy of the classical Debreu economy, and establishing a net of these equilibria which converge to an equilibrium on the whole commodity space. Other results concern the existence and price support of efficient allocations and the relationship between equilibria and the core of the allocation game.",1984,duffie,,
762,"Stochastic Equilibria: Existence, Spanning Number, and the ""No Expected Gain from Trade"" Hypothesis","Stochastic equilibria under uncertainty with continuous-time security trading and consumption  are demonstrated in a general setting. The equilibrium shown has the property of no expected financial gain from trading securities. The relevence of the ""no expected gain from trade"" hypothesis in multi-good economies is called into question by the following  demonstrated fact. For any alternative expectations a corresponding equilibrium  exists, one with the original agents, original equilibrium allocations, and no expected gains from trade under the new probability assessments. The spanning number of the economy  is defined as the fewest number of security markets required to sustain a complete markets  equilibrium (in a dynamic sense made precise in the paper). The spanning number is linked  directly to agent primitives, in particular the manner in which new information resolves uncertainty over time. The spanning number is shown to be invariant under bounded changes  in expectations. Several examples are given in which the spanning number is finite even  though the number of potential states of the world is infinite.",1984,duffie,,

A game-theoretic framework is used to   characterize the equilibrium shared ownership arrangement. Buying and leasing emerge as   special cases of the analysis. Real estate investments are emphasized as an illustrative context, where it is shown  that (1) the efficiency of shared home ownership contracts can be improved by using local housing price indices and (2) taxes encourage investors to  bear risk, resulting in reduced asset maintenance unless the   actions of the resident are   directly monitored.",1984,fwolfson,,
784,An Economic Theory of Planned Obsolescence,"Planned Obsolescence is the production of goods with  uneconomically short useful lives so that customers will have to make repeat purchases. However rational customers  will pay for only the present value of the future services of a product. Therefore profit  maximization might seem to imply producing any given flow of services as cheaply as possible, with production involving efficient useful lives.  This paper shows why the above analysis is incomplete and therefore incorrect. Monopolists  are shown to generally desire uneconomically short useful lives for their goods.  Oligopolists have the monopolist's incentive for short lives as well as a second incentive that may either increase or decrease their chosen durability. However, oligopolists can generally  gain by colluding on a low durability. The relation between the monopolists' and oligopolists' incentives to alter the rate of obsolescence and their incentives to divide their placements between sales and rentals is detailed. Some evidence is presented that appears to be generally consistent with the predictions of the theory.",1984,jbulow,,
785,Strategic Resource Extraction: When Easy Doesn't Do It,"We show that, for strategic reasons, an oligopolist in anatural resource industry might  employ a backstop technology to develop costly reserves even if it does not plan to exhaust  all less expensive deposits. The reason is that an oligopolist with increasing marginal costs  of cheap reserves essentially faces a “reverse learning curve” where increasing current output  will increase future marginal costs. If competitors are expected to respond aggressively to these increased marginal costs (as could happen, for example, in a Nash quantity game)  then a high current output will mean lower future profitability for the decision making firm.  This drop in future profitability due to changes in competitors’ strategies is a strategic cost of increased current output, and causes firms to limit first period production to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal production cost (the change in present value of total costs from raising current output by one unit and holding all future output levels constant) plus strategic cost.  Because the backstop technology may involve no strategic costs (its use today not affecting the firm’s marginal costs in the future) such a technology will be employed up to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Therefore, in equilibrium, while the private cost of both production methods must equal marginal revenue, strategic factors may lead to the use of the backstop technology over some cheaper reserves with lower social costs of extraction but higher strategic costs.",1984,jbulow,John,Geanakoplos

In order to overcome the dilution in the value of information due to its leakage through informative prices, the seller of information may prefer to sell noisier versions of the information he actually has. Moreover, to obtain higher profits, it is desirable for the seller to sell different signals to different traders, so that the added noise realizations do not affect equilibrium prices. One way of doing so, which does not require discrimination,  is to sell identically distributed personalized signals to each of a large number  of traders.",1985,admati | pfleider,,

When the purchaser is able to  make commitments for the duration of the relationship, a separating equilibrium results.  When the purchaser can only make commitments within a period, a separating equilibrium results when the supplier is prohibited from quitting the contract if he is fairly treated. Aggregate welfare is greater in this equilibrium than in the former, but the purchaser is worse off and the supplier better off. If the supplier can quit at any time, the equilibrium contract for the first period cannot be separating over any interval.",1985,dbaron,David,Besanko

811,Stochastic Equilibria with Incomplete Financial Markets,"We demonstrate the existence of equilibria with incomplete financial markets for stochastic economies whose information structure is given by an event tree. The well known examples of non-existence of equilibria are precluded by restricting attention to purely financial securities paying in units of account, rather than ""real"" securities, claiming contingent commodities. Financial markets may be incomplete: some consumption streams may be impossible to obtain by any trading strategy. Securities may be individually precluded from trade at arbitrary sets of nodes (states and dates). Sufficient conditions for the existence of stochastic equilibria are: continuous, convex, strictly monotonic preferences; and wealth accessibility: the existence of a trading strategy for each agent that, in conjunction with endowment market values, leaves strictly positive wealth at each node. A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for wealth accessibility is positive non-zero endowments for each agent at each node, and strictly positive aggregate endowments. A corollary states that any regime of security prices precluding arbitrage can be embedded in an equilibrium. That is, with fixed security prices, spot goods prices can be adjusted to clear both spot and security markets.",1985,duffie,,

813,"Price Operators: Extensions, Potentials, and the Markov Valuation of Securities","This paper provides properties of price operators, functions that map the payoff of a contingent claim to its market value as a function of the state of the economy. The principal objective is the construction of a Markov process under which the market value of a security is the expected sum of future dividends of the security, where dividends are a function of the Markov process. First we provide conditions for a norm-preserving arbitrage-free (positive) extension of an arbitrage-free price operator from the space of actually marketed assets to the space of all possible assets. This can be useful for the characterization of equilibrium in settings of asymmetric information or sequential trade. Then we show, in the multiperiod setting, that the market value of a security may be treated as the Markov potential of its dividend, and show several properties that derive from this characterization. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure for the corresponding Markov process under which the mean current value of any security is its discounted mean future payoff. The fixed discount factor is the spectral radius of the valuation operator, the largest possible fixed discount rate on any security.",1985,duffie,,

Closed form solutions for the optimal hedging strategy are provided for general ""smooth"" utility functions under the expectations hypothesis, and for exponential Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility (without the expectations hypothesis). Necessary conditions for an equilibrium are shown. Finally, the optimal hedge is provided for log-normal spot price distributions, assuming the prices of the futures are the expected prices of the spot assets at delivery.",1986,duffie,Matthew,Jackson

842,Setup Reduction and Increased Effective Capacity,"Setup reduction is an important aspect of the JustSU Time (JIT) and Zero Inventory (ZI) concepts. This paper continues the study of the benefits of such reduction. Porteus (1985b) examined the tradeoff between investment in reduced setups and operating (holding and setup) costs. He later introduced a relationship between lotsizing and quality that identified benefits, due to improved quality, to be achieved by setup reduction. Investment in improved process quality was also considered in that article. This paper looks at the increased effective capacity that results from setup reduction. A certain amount of time, as well as expense, is required for each setup within a multiproduct firm. By reducing the time required for setups, less time is required to carry out those setups. That time can either be used to reduce lot sizes from artificially high levels caused by limited capacity or to reduce overtime used. We use an EOQ-like setting with stationary deterministic demand rates for each product. This simple model allows explicit solutions to be derived, not only for optimal setup time reduction, but for optimal overtime as well. Numerical examples illustrate the results.",1986,eporteus,Anne,Spence

Hobbes' centralized solution may thus be overrated. We investigate these issues by representing ongoing collective action as an n-person repeated prisoner's dilemma. The results, summarized by 9 propositions, show that (1) decentralized conditional cooperation can ease iterated collective action dilemmas -- if all players perfectly monitor the relation between individual choices and group payoffs. Once monitoring uncertainty is introduced, (2) such strategies degrade rapidly in value; (3) centrally administered selective incentives become relatively more valuable, though freeriding may occur; (4) a nested structure, with reciprocity used in subunits and selective incentives centrally administered, combines the advantages of the decentralized and centralized solutions: more stable than the former, often securing more cooperation than the latter. Generally, the model shows that the logic of repeated collective action bears significant implications for the institutional forms of organizations seeking collective benefits.",1987,fbendor,Dilip,Mookherjee

The aggregation of information in prices tends to make signals more complementary than they would be if considered in isolation, favoring concentration of information.  However, the ability to use some signals together with prices to predict other signals may increase the degreee of substitutability among signals.

Such alternation occurs even in the absence of any apparent external influence on choice.  We present a theory and develop a model to explain such behavior, labeled balanced choice behavior.  The theory holds that the variability in individual choice stems partly fro the need to balance current consumption according to the impact of past consumption.  The model specification yields a logit model which is calibrated cross-sectionally on consumption histories.  The approach relates the parameters of the model to measures of individual behavior, permitting insight into individual varied choice.  The model is calibrated and tested using data on soft drink consumption.  In this context, th model compares favorably to certain existing models of brand choice on the basis of fit and predictive ability.",1985,jlattin,,

Prior to the resource task, a decomposed game procedure was used to classify subjects as cooperatively or noncooperatively oriented. Subjects, in groups of six, were led to believe they shared access to a replenishing resource pool via a system of linked computer terminals. Across a series of trials, subjects had to choose between maximizing their own short-term gain and exercising personal restraint to preserve the collective resource. False feedback about the group's use of the resource and the rate at which it replenished itself was varied to indicate either that the resource was being sustained or that collective overuse was rapidly depleting it. As predicted, cooperatively oriented individuals responded to resource depletion with greater self-restraint than did those classified as noncooperators. Analysis of pretrial and posttrial data indicate that social values were also related to individuals' expectations about the task and perceptions of others.",1985,rmkramer,Charles,McClintock

873,Taxation and the Dynamics of Corporate Control: The Uncertain Case for Tax Motivated Acquisitions,"We develop an analytic framework to examine the familiar claim that the tax system favors corporate acquisitions. The framework is then applied to the three most commonly identified sources of tax gains from acquisitions: the change in asset basis available through taxable acquisitions; the faster use of net operating losses available through nontaxable acquisitions; and the tax deduction available for interest paid on funds borrowed to finance acquisitions. To isolate the role of tax rules, consideration of each of the three sources of tax gains begins with examination of acquisitions and the related alternatives in a perfect market. In such a setting, the alternatives are found to weakly dominate acquisitions as a means of achieving tax gains. We then take one step closer to the real world, relaxing the perfect market assumption to introduce transaction and other information costs. These costs sometimes reinforce and sometimes weaken the perfect market results. The analysis also suggests that, at least with respect to change in basis from acquisitions, the availability of a tax gain may do more than create an incentive to engage in socially wasteful transactions that achieve only tax gains but consume real resources. It appears that in a setting of imperfect information, the provision of a tax gain from asset transfers may operate as a subsidy to mitigate the problem of underinvestment in search for enhanced operating efficiencies. After consideration of the net gains to acquisitions, examination of whether these gains explain the size of acquisition premiums leads to a negative conclusion, in large part because tax gains are anticipated.",1986,mscholes | fwolfson,Ronald,Gilson

Under some specifications of the parameters, delay is present in the unique sequential equilibrium whose beliefs satisfy one intuitive restriction.  This delay does not vanish as the minimal time between offers become small.",1986,admati,Motty,Perry
876,"An Evolutionary Perspective on Strategy-Making in Organizations: Theory, Comparative Analysis, Research Directions","This paper proposes that the strategic process in large, diversified organizations constitutes an internalized and contrived evolutionary mechanism nested in the external environmental context. The paper elaborates this argument and shows how it allows to integrate strategic management with organizational ecological theory and with other major paradigms in organization theory. Considering the direct and intervening effects of the environmental context on the strategic process, the paper suggests that inertia, adaptation, renewal, and transformation are the result of both environmental determinism and strategic choice and that different parts of the strategic process deal with environmental determinism and strategic choice. From the evolutionary perspective presented here, there is no real paradox in the view that old organizations are both more likely to manifest strategic and structural inertia and to have higher probabilities of survival. The comparative analysis of the evolutionary model presented in this paper and of the one proposed by Japanese theorists suggests that the distinction between induced and autonomous parts in the strategic process allows to clarify further the strong adaptive orientations of Japanese strategy-making and to examine its capacity to manage increasing pressures for strategic renewal. More research would be useful to establish the magnitude of various rates associated with the internal evolutionary mechanisms determining an organization's capacities for adaptation and renewal. The capacity for strategic renewal seems least well understood in the current organizational literature and would benefit most from efforts to elucidate the functioning of experimentation-and-selection processes internal to the organization.",1986,profrab,,
877,Common Behavior Changes in Successful Organization Development,"The field of Organization Development suffers from a lack of a unifying theory of planned organizatonal change.  Diverse models and methods for achieving organizational change have made integration of research difficult, hampering the advance of the field.  Identification of a ""common denominator"" to successful change efforts might begin to provide a focus ground which diverse approaches could be organized.  This paper proposes a model of  the dynamics of organizational change interventions, and suggests that individual behavior is a key mediating variable in those processes.  It then presents a study which attempted to identify and specify common behavior changes characteristic of successful change efforts by surveying 42 top scholars and practitioners in the field.  The study's participants did report behavior changes common to their interventions, and showed at least moderate agreement on waht those changes were Scholars and practitioners with differeing theoretical and action perspectives did not differ in the behaviors they saw as resulting from their successful interventions.",1986,porras,Susan,Hoffer
878,Organization Development Theory:  A Typology and Evaluation,"Two types of Organization Development theory are identified and discussed.  The first, implementation theory, focuses on the intervention activity required to carry out effective planned change efforts in organizations.  The second, change process theory, attempts to explain the dynamics through which the organization changes as a response to any intervention activity.  Evaluations of both types of theory suggest that implementation theory is more fully developed than change process theory.  However, improved theoretical development is needed in both areas.  For implementation theory, further work is needed in the development of more comprehensive diagnostic models, in the specification of conditions for effective change, and in the establishment of useful criteria for change agents.  Since change process theory is in such a fragmented state, all facets of its require further theoretical advancement.  Substantial improvement in the quality of both types of OD theory are needed to enhance the efficacy of planned change programs in organziations.",1986,porras,Peter,Robertson
880,Involuntary Unemployment and Imperfect Competition: A Game Theoretic Macro Model,"This paper considers a game-theoretic, non-Walrasian, general equilibrium model of price determination, production, and exchange. In this game, firms first select prices and wages, consumers/workers then make input supply and output demand offers, and finally firms select the fractions of these to accept. Equilibrium (pure strategy, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) involves each agent's acting optimally from each point forward while correctly recognizing the results of taking any given course of action. In particular, firms correctly forecast the quantity responses to different prices and wages. It is shown that with a particular structure of preferences, endowments and technology, if an equilibrium exists with positive levels of economic activity, then there exists another equilibrium at the same prices and wages with lower levels of activity. The latter equilibrium corresponds to involuntary unemployment. This unemployment arises because of a failure of excess demand. Given the prices and wages, no firm expects enough demand to justify greater hiring. Thus, employment, income and demand are low, and the pessimistic expectations are confirmed. Further, expectations are such that price and wage changes do not appear profitable, and, by the nature of equilibrium, these expectations are correct.",1986,jroberts,,

The data and the nonnested hypothesis tests initially indicate that no model is correctly specified. The tests are also intransitive in their assessments. Before rejecting these conventional models of investment demand, we investigate the small sample properties of these different nonnested test procedures through a series of Monte Carlo studies. We find that nonnested tests for models without serially correlated residuals have significant finite sample size and power biases. These biases persist, but are somewhat diminished, for nonnested tests that recognize serial correlation in the disturbances. The direction of the bias in the size is toward rejection of the null model, although it varies considerably by the type of test and estimation technique. After revising our critical levels for this finite sample bias, we conclude that the accelerator model of equipment investment cannot be rejected by any of the other alternatives.",1986,preiss,Ben,Bernanke

893,Detecting Multiple Outliers with an Application to R&D Productivity Studies,"Multiple outlying observations are frequently encountered in applied studies in business and economics. Several multiple outlier tests exist, but little evidence is available on their relative power against alternative types of outliers and influence. This paper analytically and numerically compares the sensitivity of these statistics to particular forms of data contamination. It also proposes new statistics. Practical issues associated with the application of these tests are illustrated by re-examining recent evidence of an R and D-productivity slowdown. New data from Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984) are used to show that the low rates of return to federal and private R and D found in other studies may be due to the presence of outliers.",1986,preiss,,

899,Direct and Indirect Sale of Information,"We compare two methods for a monopolist to sell information to traders in a financial  market. In a direct sale, buyers of the information observe (versions of) the seller's signal  and subsequently use it to make investment decisions. Alternatively, the seller can create a portfolio based on his private information and sell shares to traders. For the case of identical traders we show that if the pricing of shares is linear then there is a tradeoff between surplus extraction that is possible with direct sale and the more effective control of the usage of the information that is possible with indirect sale. The optimal selling method depends on the extent to which information is revealed by the asset equilibrium price. With general pricing schemes indirect sale is strictly more profitable. The results may be different if traders have  heterogeneous private information and there is more than one risky asset.",1986,admati | pfleider,,
903,An Efficiency Analysis of Proposed Rules to Limit Resistance to Tender Offers,"Easterbrook and Fischel have proposed a passivity rule that would prohibit target management from resisting a tender offer.  For a m model in which target management has private information about the true value of the target and tender offers are determined competitively, a passivity rule is shown to be more efficient than allowing target management to resist a tender offer when it is in the best interests of it shareholders to do so.  This results because a passivity rule eliminates the adverse selection associated with optimal resistance. A modified passivity rule styled after a proposal by Gilson is shown to be as efficient as a passivity rule for the model studied.",1986,dbaron,,

915,Equilibrium and the Role of the Firm in Incomplete Markets,"This paper studies the role of the firm in incomplete markets. Stock market equilibria are shown to exist generically in economies with ""smooth"" preferences and production sets. The set of equilibrium allocations is generically infinite. The stochastic setting is described by an arbitrary event tree. At each state and date agents trade on markets for spot commodities, common stocks, and other general securities. The goal of share value maximization by firms is shown to be generically strictly sub-optimal in equilibrium for all but (at most) a single shareholder. The Modigliani-Miller Invariance Principle, showing the irrelevance of the financial policy of the firm, is re-examined in the light of incomplete markets.",1986,duffie,Wayne,Shafer

The optimal monopolistic contract design  is shown to be Pareto optimal, while an example shows the failure of Pareto optimality for  a set of contracts forming a Nash equilibrium of the multi-exchange design game. Likewise,  in a monopolistic multi-period setting, an example shows failure of Pareto optimality, given an incentive for the exchange to induce turnover.",1986,duffie,Matthew,Jackson
918,Subperiod Aggregation and the Power of Multivariate Tests of Portfolio Efficiency,"When testing portfolio efficiency, empiricists usually perform tests using subperiods and aggregate the results in some manner. While the power of individual subperiod tests has been studied previously, little is known about the power of the aggregate test. Power is evaluated here through simulations using two different aggregation techniques. Aggregate power is substantially higher than that for a single subperiod. For example, in one scenario taken from MacKinlay (1987), aggregate power is .77 over a sixty year period but only .17 for each five year subperiod. In addition, the level of power depends on the method of aggregation.",1987,,Michael | Jay,Gibbons | Shanken

Perhaps theories about injustice, such as equity and relative deprivation, have been too narrowly construed.  To address this possibility, in a context where the consequences of injustice ideologies are vitally important, we performed a content analysis of the rhetoric of sixteen revolutionary leaders.  Results revealed unanticipated complexities, for example in the analysis of sources of injustice in the status quo, and unanticipated oversimplifications, for example in a vision of the future that was oddly devoid of justice concerns.  Implications for understanding the relatonship between justice ideologies and collective behavior are discussed.",1986,jmartin,Barbara | Maureen,Levitt | Scully

In addition to typical regularity, the assumption: not trading is Pareto inefficient -  provides demand for pure outside fiat money as a medium of exchange, and thereby a positive value for money in equilibrium. The paper includes a discussion of money in general equilibrium theory, including the issues of inefficiency, indeterminacy, non-convexities, and incomplete markets.",1986,duffie,,

Suppose the agent observes his or her current wealth only when making a transaction, that transactions are costly, and that decisions to transact can be made at any time based on all current information._x000B__x000B_(1) With lump sum plus proportional costs, the optimal interval of time between transactions varies non-trivially with current wealth._x000B__x000B_(2) If, at each transaction, the agent is charged a fixed fraction of current wealth, an optimal policy exists and the optimal interval of time betwen transactions is fixed, independent of time and current wealth.  That is, the optimal behavior is observationally equivalent to that of a pure discrete-time model, with an endogenously determined time interval",1986,duffie,Ton-sheng,Sun

The juxtaposition of archival and interview data concerning threee internal corporate venturing projects in a major corporation suggests that action and cognition are intrinsically intertwined in the emergent state of strategy-making.  Strategic action at higher levels in the managerial hierarchy benefits from the possibility to evaluate interpretative efforts of strategic action at lower levels.  A social learning model of strategy-making is useful to eclucidate the uses of strategic planning in organizatons, and provides further theoretical context for several major findings in organizational decision-making and strategic management theory.",1987,profrab,,

943,Monitoring of Performance in Organizational Contracting:  The Case of Defense Procurement,"This paper presents an agency theoretic analysis of defense procurement contracts.  In the model presented the government designs optimal linear compensation contracts for a risk-averse supplier in the presence of moral hazard, private information, and imperfect monitoring.  Optimal contracts in this setting generally invoice deviations form first-best risk sharing.  The direction of the deviation depends on the relative severity of the moral hazard and private information problems and on the precision of the monitor.  The supplier's effort decision is analyzed and, in contrast to the usual result in the moral hazard literature, the government may in some cases prefer that the supplier exert less effort given the optimal compensation contract.  The paper also studies the choice of a monitoring technology in terms of the precision of the monitor and the categories of costs covered by the monitor.  Under certain circumstances it is shown that the government may want to monitor only a fraction of the capital costs of a procurement project even though all capital costs could be costlessly monitored.",1987,dbaron,David,Besanko

957,"Nuclear Weapons, Peace and the Security Dilemma:  The Role of Cognitive Processes in Deterrence","For the past forty years, deterrence theory has played a central role in the evolution of U.S. nuclear strategy and national security policy.  Proponents of deterrence point to the historical record to argue the theory ""works"".  Recent critiques of the theory have emphasized, however, that many of the fundamental questions regarding how deterrence works remain unanswered.  For example, how do decision makers decide ""how much is enough"" to deter aggression?  What role do cognitive processes play in deterrent decisions?  The research described in this paper was designed to examine such questions.  Specifically, the effects of decision frame, salience of intergroup boundaries, and feedback regarding the economic consequences of decisions on deterrent behavior were investigated using a laboratory analogue of a security dilemma.  Results from two experiments are presented.  The first experiment confirms that decision frame and categorization can adversely affect deterrent allocations.  The second experiment suggests that reframing decisions and providing feedback regarding the costs of deterrence might reduce decisons makers' tendency to overallocate resources for defense.  The external validity of these findings are discussed, as well as implications of such research for the study of peace among the nuclear powers.",1987,rmkramer,,

963,The Dynamics of Consumer Response to Price Discounts,"The authors examine the nature of dynamic consumer response to promotional price discounts. The approach begins with the premise that consumers form expectations about future price discounting based on their exposure to such activity at the point of purchase. Consumer response is influenced by the disparity between observed discounting activity and the point of reference established by the consumer. The approach differs from existing research in three ways: first, the research is focused entirely on the effects of promotional price changes; second, a threshold model is used to capture the formation of consumer reference points; and third, the model is extended beyond brand choice to consider the effects of promotional pricing on purchase incidence. The authors calibrate models of brand choice and purchase incidence using IRI scanner panel data on ground coffee for a store-loyal panel. The findings suggest that increased exposure to discount pricing raises consumers' reference points but does not necessarily decrease the probability of brand choice. As expectations increase, consumers are more likely to buy from the category during deal periods and avoid buying during periods in which the value available in the category is low.",1987,jlattin,Randolph,Bucklin

The game has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium path, which is inefficient in the sense that  socially desirable projects may not be completed. By contrast, in a ""subscription game"" in which the cost of the contribution is borne only if and when the contributions committed to the project cover its cost, the outcome is efficient.",1990,admati,Motty,Perry

We seek to understand better the economics of the well known Just-in-Time and Total Quality Control philosophies, both of which promote gradual technological improvement as a means of achieving increased productivity and manufacturing competitiveness. In addition, there is empirical evidence that the cumulative effect of minor technical changes on productivity is often at least as important as the effect of major technological innovations. We formulate a general model of dynamic process improvement as a Markov decision process, analyze it, and apply it to the problem of setup reduction and process quality improvement. Instead of a deterministic model with a one-time investment opportunity for a large predictable technological advance, this paper builds a stochastic model with opportunities for many smaller investments over time, and in which potential process improvements may be unpredictable.*   *See PDF for complete abstract text.",1987,eporteus,Charles,Fine

While Jacobson propounds an extremely provocative argument, there are complicating patterns in his evidence that support addtional and/or different interpretations.  On the basis of these complicating patterns we argue that the marginals, ""properly defined,"" have  diminished, the swing ratio has declined, and party competition for House seats held by incumbents has lessened.  Thus, while fears that the vanishing marginals phenonmen would lead to lower responsiveness on the part of ""safe"" House incumbents have proved groundless, the colelctive composition of Congress does appear to be less responsive to changes in popular sentiments.",1987,dlbrad,Morris | Stephen,Fiorina | Ansolabeh
972,Windows of Vulnerability or Cognitive Illusions?  Cognitive Processes and the Nuclear Arms Race,"A number of recent analyses of the nuclear arms race have emphasized the role that psychological processes play in nations' decisions to arm themselves.  The present research was designed to investigate several hypotheses regarding how to cognitive processes, decision framing and the level of social differentiation in a group of interdependent decision makers, affects their decision to allocate economic resources to increase security.  It was predicted that decision makers would allocate more resources to security (arm themselves at higher levels) when decision makers would allocate more resources to security (arm themselves at higher levels) when decision frame implied high deficits in security and when the perceived level of social differentiation in their groups was high.  To test these hypotheses, two experiements were conducted using a laboratory simulation of an arms race.  The results of both experiments provided strong support for the decision framing hypothesis.  Support for the social differentiation hypothesis was more equivocal.  Social differentiation based upon perceptions of ""common fate: had inconsistent effects on behavior, while differentiation based upon naturally-ocurring social categories affected decision making as predicted. The external validity of the findings is discussed.",1987,rmkramer,,

Specifically, we present an augmented revelation principle, which states that if there exists any mechanism that implements a given choice rule, then an augmented revelation mechanism (where truthful reporting is an equilibrium) will also implement it._x000B__x000B_This principle enables us to obtain necessary conditions for a choice rule to be implementable.

To test for these interactions, we introduce a new method of measuring brand preference from past purchase data. The new method seeks to incorporate competitive purchase conditions as modifiers to observed brand purchase behavior in estimating consumer brand preference. We account for heterogeneity in the cross-sectional model by using two measures of loyalty: one to capture differences across individuals and one to capture the time-varying changes within an individual. Our empirical results, based on scanner panel data for instant caffeinated coffee, support our hypotheses and our model specification.

1029,Stochastic Inventory Theory,"Inventory theory deals with the management of stock levels of goods, with the intent of effectively meeting demands for those goods. We say the demands for goods are made by buyers and are met by sellers, regardless of whether monetary exchange is involved. Inventory of a good that is physically available is on hand stock. Demands for a quantity of a good are considered to be met when that quantity is physically transferred, out of the units on hand to the buyer. Shortages are demands that are not met immediately. Shortages are backorders if the buyers are willing to wait, and lost sales if not. Backorders are also called backlogged demand and backlogs. From time to time, the inventory manager may choose to place an order for additional quantities of the good to replenish the stock on hand. An order, for the order quantity, may be placed on an outside supplier or on an internal production facility, in which case the order quantity is a run, batch, and/or lot of the product. The order leadtime is the elapsed time from the moment an order is placed until the moment the quantity ordered is received (added to the stock on hand). That definition is purposefully vague, because of the possibility that portions of an order may be delivered at different points in time. Quantities of the good that have been ordered (by the inventory manager) but not yet received are on order. System stock, also called inventory position, is the sum of stock on hand plus on order minus backorders. It represents the amount that is available to meet future demands without placing further orders.",1988,eporteus,,

Psychological Aspects of ""Guns Versus Butter"" Decisions in a Simulated Security Dilemma","The present research investigated the role of cognitive processes in decisions regarding how much to spend on security, using a laboratory simulation of a security dilemma. Two experiments are described. The first experiment examined how perceived tradeoffs between security and wealth affect defense spending. As predicted, decision makers allocated less to security when the tradeoff between security and wealth was high. Experiment I also investigated how the act of imagining hypothetical scenarios influences individuals' security decisions. As hypothesized, individuals spent more on defense when they had imagined ""worst case"" scenarios regarding their opponent than when they had imagined ""best case"" scenarios. A second experiment was conducted to examine the joint effects of decision framing and the perception of tradeoffs on security decisions. It was found that individuals spent the least on defense when the tradeoff between security and wealth was high and decisions were framed in terms of the economic losses associated with defense spending.",1989,rmkramer,Gerald | John,Davis | Shoven

1078,Stochastic Differential Utility and Asset Pricing,"This paper presents a stochastic differential formulation of recursive utility. Sufficient conditions are given for existence, uniqueness, time consistency, monotonicity, continuity, risk aversion, concavity, and other properties. In a ""smooth"" Markov setting, it is shown that utility can be represented as a smooth function of the underlying Markov state process, yielding a generalization of the Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi characterization of optimality. As an application, homothetic representative-agent recursive utility functions are shown to imply that excess expected rates of return on securities are given by a linear conbination of the continuous-time market-portfolio based CAPM and the consumption-based CAPM. The Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross characterization of the term structure is examined with a recursive generalization, showing the response of the term structure to variations in risk aversion. The paper also introduces a new multi-commodity factor-return model, as well as an extension of the ""usual"" discounted expected value formula for asset prices.   ",1990,duffie,Larry,Epstein
1079,Stationary Markov Equilibria,"We establish conditions under which there are equilbria (in various settings) described by ergodic Markov processes with a Borel state space S. Let P(S) denote the probability measures on S, and let s - G(s) C:P(S) be a (possibly empty-valued) convex valued correspondence with closed graph characterizing intertemporal consistency, as prescribed by some particular model. A measurable set J C S is self-justified if G(s) n P(J) is not empty for all s E J. A Time-Homogeneous Markov Equilibrium (THME) for G is a self-justified set J and a measurable selection II : J - P(J) from the restriction of G to J. The paper gives sufficient conditions for existence of compact self-justified sets, and applies the theorem: If G has a compact self-justified set, then G has an THME with an ergodic measure. The applications are (i) stochastic overlapping generations equilibria, (ii) an ex- tension of the Lucas (1978) asset market equilibrium model to the case of heterogeneous agents, and (iii) equilibria for discounted stochastic games with uncountable state spaces.

A stationary competitive equilibrium is defined, shown to exist, and be Pareto optimal. The stationary equilibrium is characterized by an endogenous distribution of skilled workers across vintages. The distribution is shown to be single peaked and, under general conditions there is a lag between the time when a technology appears and the peak of it's usage, a phenomenon known as diffusion. An increase in the rate of exogenous technological change shifts the distribution of human capital to more recent vintages thereby increasing the diffusion rate._x000B__x000B_",1990,,V. | Hugo,Chari | Hopenhayn
1082,On Stationary Distributions for Dynamic Economies,"A problem that is arising with increasing frequency in dynamic economic analyses is the study of time invariant distributions. These arise in at least two classes of problems. The first is when the object of the research is an equilibrium distribution of agents indexed by some economic characteristics such as income, asset holding or employment status for individuals or the capital stocks of firms.' The second is when the object of the research is the long run, behavior of a stationary stochastic process, as occurs in capital theory for the process induced by the optimal accumulation policy. Invariant distributions for such processes provide information on their long run behavior. In particular, the problem of uniqueness of an invariant distribution is closely related to the independence of this behavior from the initial data._x000B_ Existence arguments based on continuity conditions have been well studied.2 Recently, interesting economic models have been developed where nonconvexities or switching costs give rise to discontinuous stochastic behavior3, for which those arguments are not applicable. In some of these cases, however, the existence of stationary equilibria can still be established using different methods based on stochastic monotonicity conditions. In the first part of this paper we systematically develop this fixed point theory based on some recent results in probability._x000B_ Beyond the issue of existence of stationary distributions is the question whether the sequence of predictive probability distributions of future states has a limit and whether this limit is independent of the initial data. This has been the motivation of turnpike theory in stochastic growth models. The methods currently used have not proven easy, often",1990,,Edward | Hugo,Prescott | Hopenhayn

However, there is much about the determinants of such competition that remain unclear. The primary purpose of the present chapter is to present an analysis of intergroup competition that is derived from recent social psychological research on social categorization processes and interdependent decision making in resource dilemmas. Based on this research, a general model of intergroup relations in organizations is presented. According to the model, intergroup relations are shaped by organizational factors that affect the interdependence between groups with respect to critical resources and psychological factors that affect how that interdependence is construed. The chapter draws out implications of the model with respect to such issues as the resolution of intergroup conflict, the development of intergroup cooperation, and the social nature of decision making in organizations.",1990,rmkramer,,

In  particular, we generalize the stochastic growth model, or the real business cycle model, to include a household sector using the basic framework that labor economists have studied for some time. Symmetrically with the market sector, the household sector uses labor and capital to produce output according to a stochastic technology. We calibrate the model based on  microeconomic evidence and long run considerations, simulate it, and examine its statistical properties. Our finding is that introducing home production  significantly improves the quantitative performance of the standard model along several dimensions simultaneously. It also implies a very different  interpretation of the nature of aggregate fluctuations.",1990,,Jess | Richard,Benhabib | Rogerson

1093,A Multi-Segment Theory of Price Elasticity Structure," Elasticity structure, the pattern of the cross-price elasticities characterizing a given market, is a revealing way of studying the nature of interbrand competition. Elasticity patterns, however, are often difficult to interpret because the underlying determinants of price elasticities are poorly understood. This paper develops a theory of elasticity structure which links a market's preference segmentation to the patterns found in the market's price elasticity matrix. In particular, a complex, market-level elasticity matrix may be decomposed into a small number of simple, segment-level elasticity matrices. The theory suggests ways of improving elasticity estimation and of deriving a market's segmentation structure from cross-price elasticities. The theory also shows that, under certain conditions, the market elasticity matrix is a simple transformation of the market brand switching matrix. The authors apply the theory and test its predictive validity with survey and scanner panel data collected on consumer preference structures in the grocery coffee category.",1990,seenu,Gary | Randolph,Russell | Bucklin

No restrictions are placed on the underlying information filtration (other  than the ""usual conditions"") and the agent is assumed to have a monotone, concave utility  over consumption processes that has a gradient satisfying technical conditions. Equilibrium  prices, which are general semimartingales, are shown to be given by the classical formula  of total future discounted dividends. The discount factors are given by the gradient's  Riesz representation and are explicitly computed for the case of infinite horizon stochastic  differential utilities, additive utilities being a special case. Furthermore, equilibrium price-processes are shown to be unique within a broad class of processes. The method of proof  utilizes the connection between the first order Kuhn-Tucker conditions and the martingale  property of nominal gain processes.",1991,duffie,Costis,Skiadas

Over time, the  market learns of the amount of portfolio  insurance,  and  consequently  reevaluates the previous inferences drawn  from  purchases  that  were  erroneously  regarded as based on favorable information.

1101,Capital Income Taxation and International Portfolio Choice,Distortionary proportional capital income taxation is shown to cause both static effects via portfolio re-allocation and dynamic effects via changes in the value of a claim to future transfers as well as via perceived changes in the future investment opportunity set.  The stochastic structure of returns to investment is important for understanding the consequences of a unilateral increase in the domestic tax rate.  A government choosing optimal tax policy makes a tradeoff between the increase in the perceived value of future transfers and the distortion to portfolio allocation produced by taxation.  With corporate taxation the optimal tax rate is positive.,1991,,Ingrid,Werner
1102,The Impact of Biased Feedback Strategies on Performance Judgments,"The experiment reported here concerns an evaluator's judgment of the quality of another person's performance level subsequent to that performer's own self-evaluative remarks. Specifically, we explore the attributional consequences of biased feedback strategies which involve asking the performer constraining questions --biased to elicit primarily favorable or unfavorable performance-relevant remarks. This investigation focuses on the link between awareness of constraint and attributional adjustment when a performer's ""induced"" self-evaluative comments are either in line with (i.e., congruent) or against (i.e., incongruent) the biasing implications of an evaluator's questions. The results clearly show that performance judgments were affected by the direction of the performer's self-evaluative comments, even when these comments were in line with, and thus constrained by, the evaluator's own biased feedback strategy. Moreover, such failure to adjust for constraint is apparent both in the evaluation of attitudes and in the evaluation of performance. Not only were potentially constrained self- evaluations taken to reflect the performer's true beliefs about his own ability, such self-evaluations also had an effect on judgments of the perceived quality of performance itself. Evaluators reported being quite aware that their interview questions were biased and yet they used the performer's ""constrained"" answers in reaching their own conclusions about the quality of his performance. These findings extend our knowledge of correspondence bias (i.e., the tendency to explain the behavior of others as a result of a personal disposition or ability when the behavior could just as easily be explained as a natural response to situational pressures or constraints) beyond attitudes to performance judgments. Implications of biased feedback strategies in organizational contexts where the evaluator is the source of constraint are discussed._x000B__x000B_",1990,,Linda,Ginzel
1105,"Suboptimal Policies, with Bounds, for Parameter Adaptive Decision Processes"," A parameter adaptive decision process is a sequential decision process where some parameter or parameter set impacting the rewards and/or transitions of the process is not known with certainty. Signals from the performance of the system can be processed by the decision maker as time progresses, yielding information regarding which parameter set is operative. Active learning is an essential feature of these processes, and the decision maker must choose actions that simultaneously &de the system in a preferred direction, as well as yield quality information that can be used to better prescribe future actions. If the operative parameter set is known with certainty, the parameter adaptive problem reduces to a conventional stochastic dynamic program, which is presumed solvable. This paper shows how to use the solutions to these tractable, conventional dynamic programs to derive suboptimal policies with performance bounds for the parameter adaptive problem. An example inventory stocking problem demonstrates the technique.",1995,,William,Lovejoy
1107,When in Doubt . . . :  Cooperation in a Noisy Prisoner's Dilemma,"In the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in problems of cooperation, stimulated largely by Axelrod's work. Using an innovative tournament approach, Axelrod found that a simple strategy, Tit-for-Tat (TFT), was most successful in playing the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD). However, recent analytic work has shown that monitoring problems caused by noise significantly impair TFT's effectiveness. The primary purpose of the present research is to discover whether there exist alternative strategies that perform well in a noisy PD. To investigate this question, we conducted a computer tournament. In general, effective strategies were generous (i.e., cooperated more than their partners did). TFT, which uses strict reciprocity, performed rather poorly in our tournament, in sharp contrast to Axelrod's original results.",1990,rmkramer | fbendor,Suzanne,Stout

A quota-based compensation scheme (i.e., salary plus commission proportional to sales beyond the quota) has the advantage of being simple. The quota-based compensation scheme derived using the agency theoretic paradigm has the property that the compensation scheme is equitable, i.e., for similar salespersons covering different territories, the salary, the commission rate, and the expected total compensation remain the same, but the quotas vary depending on the sales levels of the different territories. We also show that quota-based compensation schemes are flexible in that they offer management considerable ability to cope with changing business conditions._x000B__x000B_",1990,seenu,Jagmohan,Raju

Assuming that preannouncement is made by some of the liquidity traders, we examine two possible effects it might have on the financial market equilibrium. First, since it identifies certain trades as informationless, preannouncement changes the nature of any informational asymmetries that might exist in the market. Second, preannouncement can coordinate the supply and demand of liquidity in the market. We show that in most cases preannouncement reduces the trading costs of the those who preannounce, but its effects on the trading costs and welfare of other traders can be positive or negative. We also examine the implications of preannouncement for the distribution of prices and the amount of information prices reveal._x000B_",1990,admati | pfleider,,

1123,Response Time Design in Integrated Order Processing/Production Systems," We consider a single-product firm in which arriving orders are processed by an information processing system before being downloaded to the production system. The design problem is to choose an appropriate technology for the information (production) systems, the decision variables being the speed with which these systems can process orders (prod- ucts). Rapid systems are assumed to be more costly to operate than. slower systems, and it is assumed that products can be inventoried but information processing cannot. Longer information processing times incur greater delay costs but provide benefits in the form of more advanced warning of upcoming demand to the production function. It is shown that this information benefit will never outweigh the delay cost, leading to a set of plausible conditions under which the information processing time will never exceed the production cycle time in an optimal design. Conditions are also supplied that guarantee that the greatest marginal benefit, starting from a suboptimal system design, will be to invest in time reductions in the information processing, rather than the production, system. Performance measures are suggested that provide the appropriate design and information transfer incentives to the information processing and production functions.",1991,fwhang,William,Lovejoy

There are a number of reasons for this development.  First, following the crash of 1987 and, more generally, given the increasing complexity of the trading environment, many policy issues include the interaction between different exchanges where the same or very closely related securities are traded, the role of designated market makers, the desirable degree of competition among market makers, the type of information which should be communicated during the trading process to various participants (e.g., what information about the trading process should become public and when, how should communication between market makers and different exchanges be structured), and so on.  A number of reports issued after the stock market crash have emphasized the need to study the details of the trading process.  Since the interaction between asymmetrically informed traders is central to many of the questions in this area, it has become important to work with models in which traders are asymmetrically informed.",1991,admati,,
1126,Converting from Independent to Employee Sales Forces: The Role of Perceived Switching Costs,"Manufacturers selling into the U.S. market often use  independent sales agencies (manufacturers' representatives) to serve some or  all of their customers.  We model a manufacturer's intention to replace  its independent sales agents by integrating forward into selling (setting up its own sales force).  This intention is cast as a function of several factors, particularly managerial perceptions of the overall ""cost' (roughly, disutility or difficulty) of switching away from the agent and dissatisfaction with the current agent.  These forces are themselves described by two sub-models. In particular, managerial perceptions of overall switching costs are modeled as a function of observable factors (such as the difficulty of recruiting and training salespeople) and less easily observed factors (such as the agent's likely reaction).  The intention-to-integrate model and its associated submodels (switching costs and dissatisfaction with the agent) are estimated using survey data from 243 manufacturers currently using manufacturers' representatives.  Results indicate that perceived overall switching costs are heavily influenced by set-up factors, are little influenced by take-down factors, and are somewhat influenced by the decision itself, i.e. ""cost estimates"" are revised to fit a decision made on other grounds.  Results also indicate considerable inertia in the manufacturer/agent relationship and suggest some reasons for the stability of these arrangements._x000B__x000B_",1991,,Erin | Allen,Anderson | Weiss
1128,Electoral Cycles and International Policy Coordination,"This paper analyzes the interaction between domestic politics and international policy coordination as a two-level repeated prisoners' dilemma. At the domestic level, political competition generates an electoral cycle in monetary growth rates and real output. At the international level, the policy-makers' desire to promote domestic expansion by devaluing the currency gives rise to an inflationary bias in their monetary policies. The policy-makers' incentives to cooperate at one level are affected by the extent to which they are engaged in cooperation at the other level. It is shown that a move towards international cooperation, which reduces the inflationary bias in monetary policy, may increase the amplitude of the electoral cycle. The conditions are derived under which international cooperation has a stabilizing effect on domestic politics by strengthening the incentives of domestic policy-makers to avoid generating an electoral cycle in the first place.",1991,,Susanne,Lohmann

The information is pertinent to the individuals' voting decisions in a two candidate election that is decided by majority rule. While the incumbent is committed to maintain the status quo, the challenger will implement a policy alternative if she is elected. By engaging in political action prior to the election, individuals signal their private information to the electorate in order to affect the election outcome. Based on the number of individuals who are publicly observed to take political action, the electorate rationally updates on the benefits to be derived from overturning the status quo in favor of the policy alternative. If the number of individuals engaged in political action exceeds a critical level, a majority votes in favor of a change in policy.",1991,,Susanne,Lohmann

We also provide evidence that a firm's own earnings and other firms' earnings are not substitutes (or complements) for one another-, rather, the response coefficient on a firm's earnings is the same regardless of whether or not other firms' earnings are already known._x000B__x000B_",1991,,Russell | Mark,Lundholm | Lang
1135,Stopped Myopic Policies in Some Inventory Models with Generalized Demand Processes,"This paper considers single-item inventory systems with immediate delivery and no economies of scale.  Bounds are provided on the value loss relative to optimal cost for restricting attention to the class of inventory stocking policies that behave myopically up to a specified stopping time.  The stopping time may be random, and may depend on demand histories as well as information exogenous to the firm.  The bounds are robust to the nature of the demand process faced after the stopping time, so are applicable when the statistics of demand after the stopping time are unknown.  Stopping times that are large with high probability imply that near-term decisions are completely specified with high probability.  The general bounding results allow one to consider demand processes that may otherwise be analytically intractable._x000B_  It is shown that the class of demand models for which the assumption of additive i.i.d. shocks is appropriate is the same class admitting effective myopic stocking policies.  The bounds also make rigorous the intuitive notion that myopic policies are least effective in systems with precipitous drops in demand coupled with an inability to recover cash invested in inventory.  The option of selling inventory at discount is a reality in many real systems and enhances the attractiveness of the myopic stocking policy._x000B_   In numerical examples, the myopic policy is shown to be an effective competitor in a range of systems for which optimal policies are not known. The results suggest that for systems with immediate delivery, no economies of scale, and no currently known optimal policy, the myopic stocking rule is a reasonable default policy to adopt._x000B_",1991,,William,Lovejoy

1139,On Intertemporal Preferences for Uncertain Consumption: A Continuous Time Approach,"We propose a family of topologies on the space of consumption patterns in continuous time under uncertainty. Preferences continuous in any of the proposed topologies treat consumptions at nearby dates as almost perfect substitutes except possibly at information surprises. The topological duals of the family of proposed topologies essentially contain processes that are the sums of processes of absolutely continuous paths and martingales. Thus if equilibrium prices for consumption come from the duals, consumptions at nearly adjacent dates in a state of nature have almost equal prices except possibly at information surprises. In particular, if the information structure is generated by a Brownian motion, the duals are composed of Ito processes. We investigate some implications of our topologies on standard models of choice in continuous time as well as on recent models of non time-separable representations of preferences. We also discuss the properties of prices of long-lived assets in economies populated with agents whose preferences are continuous in our topologies when there are no arbitrage opportunities._x000B_",1991,,Ayman | Chi-fu,Hindy | Huang

A brand is said to have positive (negative) customer-based brand equity when consumers react more (less) favorably to marketing mix activity for the brand as compared to when the same marketing activity is attributed to a hypothetical or unnamed version of the product or service. Brand knowledge is conceptualized according to an associative network memory model in terms of two components: Brand awareness and brand image (Le., a set of brand associations).

1145,Marketing in Turbulent Environments:  Decision Processes and the Time-Value of Information,"This paper studies the relationship between information-processing, marketing decisions and performance in turbulent markets -- i.e., markets in which the time-value of information is a major factor in decision-making. Drawing on both organizational contingency theory and individual behavioral decision research, we suggest that successful performance depends on the congruence between the level of marketplace turbulence and the information-processing style and associated decisions adopted. We focus by way of example on the decision processes embodied informal planning procedures. Using the results from an experiment conducted with a strategic marketing simulation game, we show that ""planning"" leads to an underweighting of the time-value of marketplace information and thus a bias in favor of certain marketing decisions over others -- decisions which, in this case, result in inferior performance when compared with that of decision- makers not engaged in formal planning. We discuss the implications of the findings for managerial behavior in high turbulent markets._x000B__x000B_",1991,,Allen | Rashi,Weiss | Glazer
1146,Adoption of Technologies with Network Effects,"The literature on networks suggests that the value of a network is positively affected by the number of geographically dispersed locations it serves (the ""network effect"") and the number of its users (the ""production scale effect""). We show that as a result a firm's expected time until adoption of technologies with network effects declines in both users and locations. We provide empirical evidence on the adoption of automated teller machines by banks that is consistent with this prediction. Using standard duration models, we find that a bank's date of adoption is decreasing in the number of its branches (a proxy for the number of locations and hence for the network effect) and the value of its deposits (a proxy for number of users and hence for production scale economies). The network effect is the larger of the two effects.",1991,saloner,Andrea,Shepard

We obtain the precise 'menu"" of warranty contracts, and then make connections with its institutional counterpart: the extended service contract._x000B_ The model's implications for consumer behavior are examined using data obtained from a sample of recent buyers of new cars. The role of risk in consumer behavior with respect to choice of extended service contracts, and the allocation of effort for maintenance are found to be consistent with the model's predictions._x000B_ From a managerial perspective, our empirical analysis permits quantifying the demand for extended service contracts as a function of the extent of manufacturer warranty.

1150,Rational Frenzies and Crashes,"Most markets clear through a sequence of sales rather than through a Walrasian auctioneer. Because buyers can decide between buying now or later, rather than only now or never, buyers' current ""willingness to pay' is much more sensitive to price than is the demand curve. A consequence is that markets will be extremely sensitive to new information, leading to both ""frenzies,"" where demand feeds upon itself, and ""crashes, where price drops discontinuously. Although no buyer's independent reservation value reveals much about overall demand, a small increase in one such value can cause a large increase or decrease in average price.",1991,jbulow,Paul,Klemperer
1151,Campaign Contributions and Party-Candidate Competition in Services and Policies,"I. Introduction Political parties, their candidates, and their contributors are involved in a complex relationship in which policy positions are taken by parties, candidates compete for votes and for campaign contributions, interest groups and individuals make campaign contributions, elections are held, and successful candidates take actions some of which may benefit their contributors. Electoral competition thus involves both parties and their candidates, and competition takes place both in policy positions and in services provided to constituents and interest groups. In the model, the sophisticated players are parties, candidates, and interest groups, and voters are assumed to be unsophisticated and to vote based on the electoral campaigns. Parties choose policies, candidates provide services, and interest groups make campaign contributions in response to offers of services. The model is intended to reflect the importance of services provided to contributors and to recognize that it is candidates rather than parties that provide services. Furthermore, those services which are private can be provided by whichever candidate is the winner of the election. The model also recognizes that the preferences of parties and candidates can differ, particularly because the candidates and not parties are the providers of services. The theory developed here characterizes the equilibrium relationship among 1) the strategies of parties as they compete through policy position-taking and candidates as they compete by pledging to provide services to interest groups, 2) the campaign contribution strategies of interest groups, and 3) the effect of those contributions on expectations about election outcomes. Parties are assumed to have preferences both for winning and for policy outcomes, and candidates have preferences for being in office but incur a cost of providing constituent ser- _x000B_",1991,dbaron,Jongryn,Mo
1153,Leadership Style and Incentives,"We study the relationship between a firm's environment and its optimal leadership style. We show that leadership style is a function of the CEO's personality and affects the firm's profitability. We use a model in which contracts between the firm (or CEO) and managers are incomplete so that providing incentives to subordinates is not straightforward. The personality of the CEO, and in particular the degree of empathy with other employees, then affects the incentive contracts that can be offered to subordinates. We show that shareholders gain from appointing empathic CEOs, who adopt a participatory style, when the firm has the potential for exploiting numerous innovative ideas. By contrast, when the environment is poor in new ideas, shareholders benefit from hiring a less empathic (profit maximizing) CEO whose style is more autocratic.",1991,saloner,Julio,Rotemberg
1154,Viable Prices in Financial Markets with Solvency Constraints,"We study the viability of a securities market model with continuous trading in which agents are required to remain solvent at all times and cannot add funds to their portfolio of securities in excess of an exogenous endowment. We show that viability, a notion introduced by Harrison and Kreps (1979), is equivalent to the existence of a pair of continuous linear functionals, defined on the consumption space and market value space, such that their sum extends the market linear pricing rule. We also show that viability is equivalent to the existence of an adjustment process, such that the adjusted total gains from any asset with positive dividends is a supermartingale. The adjustment process itself is a strictly positive supermartingale. In particular, the price of any asset with positive dividends can be decomposed into two parts: a martingale up to a stopping time and a nonnegative supermartingale which is identically equal to zero at the terminal date. The first part is the value of future cash flows after adjusting for timing and riskiness. The second component is the value due to the solvency services of the asset.",1991,,Ayman,Hindy
1155,Asset Pricing with Stochastic Differential Utility,"This paper presents asset pricing theory with representative-agent utility given by a stochastic differential formulation of recursive utility. Asset returns are characterized from general first order conditions of the Hamilton-Bellman-Jacobi equation for optimal control. Homothetic representative-agent recursive utility functions are shown to imply that excess expected rates of return on securities are given by a linear combination of the continuous-time market-portfolio based CAPM and the consumption-based CAPM. The Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross characterization of the term structure is examined with a recursive generalization, showing the response of the term structure to variations in risk aversion. The paper also introduces a new multi-commodity factor-return model, as well as an extension of the ""usual"" discounted expected value formula for asset prices._x000B_",1991,duffie,Larry,Epstein
1156,Spanning in Security Markets and The Modigliani-Miller TheoremTwo Essays for the The New Palgrave,"The span of a given collection of securities is the set of state-contingent claims to value that can be obtained by trading the securities. In a simple one-period model, this is literally the linear span (the set of all finite linear combinations) of the payoffs of the individual securities. For example, if there are n securities whose payoffs are represented by the random variables X1,...,Xn (OD some probability space), their span is the set of all payoffs of the form a] X1+...+ anxn, where al, - - -, an are constants representing the numbers of units of the respective securities held in a given portfolio._x000B_ In a multi-period model, the opportunity to retrade in each successive period dramatically increases the span of a given set of securities. For example, the option pricing model of Black and Scholes (1973) has two primitive securities, a bond and the stock on which the option is written. Their span, in a dynamic sense, is the set of all contingent claims that can be generated by trading the stock and the bond over time. In this model, under idealistic conditions such as the absence of transactions costs, independently distributed stock returns, continuous price paths, and the ability to trade continually and with unlimited speed, the span of the stock and bond contains any contingent claim whose payoffs can be viewed as a (measurable) function of the path taken by the stock price. A call option on the stock is thus in the span. This fact is of particular interest in finance because it implies, in the absence of arbitrage, that the price C of the call option must be the amount V that one invests in the stock and the bond in order to synthesize the option payoff. If not, say if C > V, then one could create an arbitrage by selling the option for C and investing V in the stock-bond strategy that replicates the option payoff. There would be an initial riskless profit of C - V, and no further cash flows since the payoff of the option replication strategy meets any obligations from the short option position. There is a like arbitrage if C < V, so the modeled option price is V, which is known explicitly under certain assumptions._x000B_ The application of spanning in the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been extended to the point that it is now the most commonly used approach in the business world for pricing securities. Like the Black-Scboles model itself, most of its extensions are partial equilibrium models in which certain ""primitive"" security prices are taken as given, with the focus placed on pricing other ""derivative"" securities whose payoffs are in the span of the_x000B_      2_x000B_",1991,duffie,,

The original Holmstrom-Milgrom solution applies under this dynamic constraint, but not generally under the static constraint formulated by Holmstrom and Milgrom. With only a static initial incentive compatibility constraint, the Holmstrom- Milgrom solution is an equilibrium for, essentially, only a special quadratic cost-of- effort function._x000B__x000B_",1991,duffie,Costis,Skiadas

In other words, markets are incomplete in an essential way. The problem is solved by demonstrating, using analytic and in particular ""viscosity solutions' techniques, that the value function of the stochastic control problem is a smooth solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The optimal policy is then given from the first order conditions of the HJB equation.",1992,duffie,Wendell | Thaleia,Fleming | Zariphop

""Vision"" is a term frequently tossed about by academics and practicing managers, but there's been a scarcity of clear concepts and useful tools -- in short, the absence of a coherent conceptual framework. Our framework has been developed and enriched by both research and practice on a variety of organizations, and by a rigorous examination of twenty companies identified as some of the world's most visionary. One primary contribution of the framework is that it removes the ""fuzziness"" surrounding the topic of vision, yet, at the same time, preserves the magic - the spark -- that's an essential quality of an effective vision._x000B_",1991,porras,James,Collins
1160,"Organization Development: Theory, Research, and Practice","To him who devotes his life to science, nothing can give more happiness than increasing the number of discoveries. But his cup of joy is full when the results of his studies immediately find practical application. There are not two sciences. There is only one science and the application of science, and these two activities are linke as the fruit is to the tree.      Louis Pasteur    Organization Development (OD) is the practical application of organization science. Drawing from several disciplines for its models, strategies, and techniques, OD focuses on the planned change of human systems and contributes to organization science through the knowledge gained from its study of complex change dynamics. The field follows Kurt Lewin's two dicta, ""In or-der to truly understand something, try changing it."" and ""There is nothing as practical as a good theory."" The interplay between scientific theory development and its application makes OD an exciting and vibrant part of organization studies.   Although a substantial number of important contributions have been made, the field has had its problems, some of which have plagued it from the beginning. Many of OD's problems relate to its relative newness as an academic field; it has been in existence slightly more than three decades. Some derive from the enormous complexity that exists in the processes OD attempts to map. Consequently, OD's theoretical base is unsettled; there are blurred conceptualizations of the OD process and inadequate understandings of its underlying change mechanisms. In add ion, significant questions about the robustness of OD research methods cast doubt on the validity of many research findings. Moreover, the tendency to emphasize action over systematic evaluation of OD's -effects results in a less than desired data base for the field. Finally, the field has, for some, a ""messianic' rather than scientific flavor because of its normative humanistic value based roots. These factors make the field a difficult as well as challenging arena for both research and practice.   The purpose of this chapter is to capture some of the vitality and complexity of OD and to present its theory, practice, and research in such a way that the reader can better comprehend the essence of the field, where it is now and where it is headed. We begin with brief introductory comments on organizational change as a construct and a definition of Organization Development. We expand on this definition by presenting a perspective on organizational change based on Porras' (Porras, 1986, 1987; Porras & Silvers, 199 1) organizational framework. A discussion of OD theory follows, concentrating on two types, change process theory and change implementation theory. Next, we broadly describe the vast array of intervention techniques currently popular in the field and discuss a few in depth. Then, we describe research findings on the effects of OD, and discuss what OD does and does",1991,porras,Peter,Robertson
1161,Government Formation and Endogenous Parties,"This paper provides a formal theory of government for a political system characterized by a proportional representation electoral system, a parliamentary government that exercises collective responsibility, and a government formation process. Political parties are assumed to be policy-oriented and serve the interests of those who vote for them. Parties choose policy platforms which determine their representation in parliament, and given that representation, the parties bargain over the government to be formed and the policies that government will implement. Equilibria have the property that parties choose dispersed policy positions. The theory thus provides predictions of party locations such as those developed in the manifesto project.",1991,dbaron,,
1162,Optimal Taxation in Models of Endogenous Growth,"We study the problem of optimal taxation in horizon representative agent models of endogenous growth. The first model is a convex model with no externalities in which physical and human capital are perfectly symmetric in use and accumulation. We compute exact solutions to a finite horizon version of this model and find large growth and welfare effects of a shift from the current to the ramsey optimal tax policy. Our second model incorporates elastic labor supply through a lucas-style technology in which effective labor is produced by combining human capital, raw labor and market goods. In this model, there are large effects on growth, welfare and labor supply._x000B_ Our simulations of the first two models point out the dangers of assuming that government expenditures are exogenously given. Due to the growth effects of changes in the tax system, government expenditures shrink to a negligible fraction of output. In our third model, we include government expenditures as a productive input in capital formation, show that the limiting tax rate on capital is no longer zero, and find large growth and welfare effects in numerical simulations._x000B_",1991,,Larry | Rodolfo,Jones | Manuelli
1163,Standing on the Shoulders of Others: Institutional Interdependence in Job Mobility,"Organizations often hire workers whom they will not promote. We think that this practice triggers career interdependence, where hiring un- promotable workers sometimes harms but in some cases helps the mobility chances of other employees. We identify conditions that should shape such interdependence, and test our ideas by analyzing how the hiring of temporary workers affected the mobility of permanent workers in a large organization. It is expected that hiring temporary workers (1) slows permanent-worker mobility among workers at low ranks and (2) speeds mobility among advanced workers, and that these effects (3) hold for vacancy promotions but not for upgrade promotions. These hypotheses are largely supported by rate-dependent accelerated duration models estimated using event-history data on 6,850 workers over a 14-year period. The results indicate that the hiring of unpromotable workers can create a ""hidden escalator"" favoring core workers, and suggests the value of more research into the institutional sources of career interdependence.",1991,fbarnett,Anne,Miner

The elements of the market-level cross-price elasticity matrix are shown to be proportional (via a single scaling constant) to the corresponding elements of the market-level brand switching matrix (when expressed in row conditional form). Market-level own-price elasticities are shown to be proportional (via the negative of the same scaling constant) to one minus the corresponding diagonal elements of the row conditional switching matrix. The authors empirically assess this theoretical correspondence using scanner panel data for the liquid laundry detergent category. The own and cross-price elasticities based on the brand switching matrix are (1) predictive of aggregate market share variation due to price changes, and (2) outperform regression-based elasticity estimates in a hold-out time period._x000B_",1991,seenu,Gary | Randolph,Russell | Bucklin

Some conclude that these ""multipoint"" rivals should deter one another from competing, but empirical support for this hypothesis is lacking. Using an integration of strategic and ecological theories, this paper predicts that multipoint contact affects competition within but not between strategic groups, and that whether multipoint contact deters competition depends on firms' strategies. These predictions are supported by ecological models of market exit rates in the customer premises equipment and service (CPES) sector of the deregulated American telephone industry. Evidence also is found that strategic groups not protected by mobility barriers face strong competition from other strategic groups.",1991,fbarnett,,

The Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem is applied to establish existence of fixed points of mappings on compact sets of measures that are increasing with respect to a stochastic ordering. Global convergence of a monotone markov process to its unique invariant distribution is established under an easily verified assumption. Topkis' theory of supermodular functions is applied to stochastic dynamic optimization, providing conditions under which optimal stationary decisions are monotone functions of the state and induce a monotone markov process.

1170,Robust Financial Contracting and the Role of Venture Capitalists,"This paper analyzes a model of financing for start-up companies, focusing on the investment decisions that are made in later stages of financing and on the interaction between entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and other capital providers. We show that when a venture capitalist is not involved in the financing, information asymmetries cannot generally be resolved costlessly through the entrepreneur's choice of securities at each financing stage. We then show that unresolved information asymmetries can lead to suboptimal investment decisions. When a venture capitalist is involved in making the investment decisions in later stages of the project, we show that optimal decisons will be made in all contingencies if and only if the venture capitalist is given what we call a fixed-fraction equity contract. In such a contract the venture capitalist receives the same fraction of the project's payoff independent of the continuation decision, and also finances that same fraction of any future investment. This implies that capital providers other than the ""lead"" venture capitalist will be involved in later financing rounds. When given a fixed-fraction equity contract, the venture capitalist can play an important role in facilitating the interaction with other investors, since with this contract he has no incentives to misrepresent his information or to misprice new securities._x000B__x000B_",1994,admati | pfleider,,

Informed voters, however, vote based on those policies, so candidates face a tradeoff between choosing a policy to generate contributions and choosing a policy to attract the informed vote. Policies are represented in a one-dimensional space, and electoral equilibria are characterized for two categories of policies: particularistic and collective. In the case of particularistic policies, the equilibrium policies of the candidates are separated if the proportion of uninformed voters is sufficiently high, and the degree of separation is an increasing function of that proportion. For all the variants of the model considered, the odds ratio for the election equals the ratio of the campaign contributions raised by the two candidates. For the case of collective policies, the candidates locate at the median of the ideal points of the informed voters and contributions are zero.",1991,dbaron,,
1176,Salesforce Compensation Plans:  An Individual Level Analysis,"A series of recent analytic papers have investigated the issue of how to compensate a salesforce using either the agency theory paradigm or transaction cost analysis. Similarly other more descriptive investigations have led to practical guidelines for managing compensation plans (Smyth 1968). These two approaches are difficult to reconcile since there is no direct mapping between the more managerially relevant independent variables used in the descriptive literature and the more abstract variables used in the analytic frame-works. While several empirical studies have focused on the predictions of the analytical frameworks, in this paper we test the guidelines provided in the descriptive literature, as in Smyth (1968). Our study is unique in that it uses cross-sectional data at the individual level in relating the effect of various independent variables to salesperson specific compensation plans. Although, our results support many of the guidelines suggested by Smyth, we do not find support for his guidelines that: the proportion of incentive pay should decrease if the company places more reliance on advertising or if the company has a quality advantage over its competitors. Finally, we use the agency theory framework to rationalize our findings with respect to reliance on advertising and existence of quality advantage as it effects the proportion of incentive pay._x000B_",1991,,Rajiv | Richard,Lal | Staelin

To explain such biases, previous research has focused primarily on how cognitive processes affect negotiation processes. In contrast, the present study investigated the impact of motivational and affective processes on negotiator judgment. Drawing on recent social psychological research on self-enhancement biases and positive illusions, we hypothesized that positive mood and the motivation to maintain high self-esteem contribute to negotiator overconfidence and overly positive self-evaluation. A laboratory experiment using a dyadic negotiation was conducted to test these hypotheses. The results of the experiment supported our major predictions that high self-esteem and positive mood affected negotiators' confidence and optimism prior to negotiation, as well as their post-negotiation evaluations of performance. Implications of these results for understanding why negotiators often fail to reach optimal agreements are discussed._x000B_",1991,rmkramer,Elizabeth | Pamela,Newton | Pommeren

Our principal conclusion is that the prospect of organizational decline and layoffs creates additional influence costs in multi-unit organizations that would be absent if there was no prospect of layoffs and would be lessened or eliminated in focused organizations.

1184,Optimal Review Frequency in Concurrent Engineering,"Concurrent engineering can reduce the time required to develop new products.  In contrast to the conventional approach, in which the product design is (nearly) completed before it is ""thrown over the wall"" to process design group, concurrent engineering, as conceptualized here, conducts a number of progress reviews during the design process.  Frequent  reveiws have two benefits:  (1) (Parallel Development) process designers receive sufficient information about the design to enable them to work in parallel with the product designers, and (2) (Quality Control) flaws in the design are discovered soon after they are introduced, saving the time and resources required for redesign later.  The disadvantage of frequent  reviews is that each review requires setup/preparation time that would otherwise not be required.  The form of the optimal policy is derived when the number of reviews is fixed and the review periods are continuous variables.  In one case, the optimal review periods are equal and are given by an EOQ-like formula.  In another, the review periods form a geometric sequence.  In others, a hybrid, with a geometric phase and constant phase, is optimal.  Explicit solutions for the optimal review policy are obtained when a first order approximation of the objective function is used.  A numerical example illustrates the results.",1992,eporteus,Albert,Ha
1186,"Inequality, Distributive Injustice and Organizational Illegitimacy","This chapter analyzes the ways some organzational theories reflect the viewpoints of the relatively prosperous, while ignoring the perspectives of the less advantaged.  For example, research on institutional theory, internal labor markets, and occupational gender segregation often assume that common organizational arrangements are perceived as legitimate (right and just), even by these legitimacy assumptions may sometimes be invalid.  For example, when inequality between groups is large, disadvantaged people may fee that their entire group is unjustly treated.  If sufficient mobilization resources are available, they may engage in collective action to change the system.  If collective action is not feasible, they may continue to feel unjustly treated and show those feelings via individual reactions, such as drug dependency, exit, mental illness, etc.  Distributive justice research suggests that the legitimacy assumptions that lie at the heart of many organizational theories should be empirically tested, with a focus on the viewpoints of members of disadvantaged groups.  Under some conditions, they expect their rewards to be low an find this dissatisfying and unjust.",1992,jmartin,,

The resulting solution concept, called a tau-theory, allows for exogenous restrictions on the beliefs of rational prayers. The solution concept is used to analyze the main concerns of the Nash equilibrium refinements literature such as dominance, iterative dominance, extensive form rationality, invariance, backward induction and forward induction. The relationship between tau-theories and dynamic learning is investigated.",1992,,Faruk,Gul
1193,Contractual Arrangements in Franchising:  An Empirical Investigation,"In this paper we conduct an empirical investigation of the recent explanations offered for the nature of a franchising contract.  In particular, we focus on the arguments posited by Lal (1990) where it is suggested that since both the franchisor's brand name investments and the franchisee's service level affect retail demand and such decisions are not verifiable by the other party, the royalty payments are used to balance the incentives to both the franchisor and the franchisee for adequate investments in factors affecting retail demand.  Lal hypothesizes that while the size of brand name investments should be inversely related to the royalty rate, the level of service provided by the franchise should be inversely related to the royalty rate.  Lal also uses a mixed strategy equilibrium concept to analyze monitoring arrangement in franchising contracts and relates the service level offered by the franchise and the frequency with which the franchisor monitors a franchisee to several independent variables.  Our empirical analysis conducted across seven different types of businesses provides support for most of these hypotheses.  To reconcile the differences between the data and one of the propositions (rejected by the data), we extend the model in Lal (1990) to include heterogeneity in monitoring costs across franchisees.  Finally, we collect additional data to test the empirical validity of the extended version of the model.  In this way, we are not only able to understand the reasons for the differences between the data and hypothesized relationships but are also able to offer empirical validity to the post hoc reasoning used to reconcile these differences.",1992,,Rajiv | Deepak,Lal | Agrawal
1195,On the Clustering of Agents' Decisions:  Herd Behavior Versus the Endogenous Timing of Actions,"The purpose of thie paper is to analyze the observed similarity of agents' decisions.  In what follows we will distinguish between clustering, which is the observation that agents' decisions tend to be very similar, and herding, which is the statement that clustering occurs because some agents ignore their own information entirely.  We provide a formal definition of clustering, illustrate a simple mechanism for clustering that does not involve herding and argue that clustering is likely to be a common phenomenon while herding is not.  In particular, we consider a setting where agents choose both an action and the time at which to take the action.  We show that allowing agents to choose when to act creates clustering, even when the previously studied motivations for herding are absent.",1992,,Faruk | Russell,Gul | Lundholm
1196,A Status-Based Model of Market Competition,"This paper explores the significance of status processes for generating and reproducing hierachy among producers in a market.  A producer's status is defined as the degree to which market participants perceive the quality of its product to be superior to that of its competitors, and a ""loose linkage"" between status and actual quality is posited.  Because of this loose linkage, it is possible to distinguish between a producer and a status position in much the same way that the distinction is drawn betweeen actors an positions in organizational contexts.  The status position of a producer circumscribes the producer's actions by providing a unique cost and revenue profile for manufacturing a good of a given level of quality.  Specifically, a higher status producer can offer a good of a given quality at a lower cost and potentially higher revenue than its lower status counterparts.  The relatively advantageous cost profile insulates the higher status producer from a ""bidding war"" with lower competitors and provides it with an incentive to reproduce its level of quality.  At the same time, the higher status producer is prevented from invading low status niches by a constraint implicit in its identity.  To increase its market share through the formation of additional exchange relations with other market actors is to change how it is perceived and, thus, potentially undercut the source of the initial advantage.  An examination of pricing behavior among investment banks in the underwriting of corporate securities provides empirical support for this status-based model of market competition.  Extensions are discussed.",1992,,Joel,Podolny
1197,Usage Heterogeneity and Extended Service Contracts,"We highlight the role of the consumer heterogeneity in product use on the demand for product warranties.  We show that the firm can satisfy the warranty demands created by this heterogeneity through the marketing of optional extended service contracts.  We characterize analytically, the menu of service contracts that the firm should offer.  We show that the menu of service contracts obtains self-selection of the consumers and  and the consequent price discrimination improves the firm's profits.  We empirically validate the consumer behavior predictions of themodel using data from a survey of new car buyers.  The empirical analysis suggests, that other things being equal, heavy users prefer an additional 1.4 year and 26,000 miles of extra warranty coverage over the base warranty.  The results are also useful in providing managers with a measure of the elasticity of sales of service contracts to changes in the length of the base warranty.",1992,,V.,Padmanabhan
1198,The Social Character of Economic Exchange,"Sociological work on markets has called into questio the validity of certain traditionally accepted distinctions between social and economic exchange.  Work in this area has shown economic exchange to be structural in the sense stressed by Emerson, where pre-existing patterns of relations constrict the flow of resources and thereby influence both market bheavior and market outcomes.  In line with the prior work, this paper seeks to further undermine accepted distinctions between these two forms of exchange.  However, it does so not by focusing on the structural concerns at the core of Emerson's work, but by exploring the economic significance of status processes to which early social exchange theorists such as Blau and Homans gave attention.   This paper argues that as long as individual or organizational actors lack perfect information on the goods which confront them in the market, then an action orientation toward status is a central element of economic exchange.  This general claim is then tested through an examination of co-brokerage relations in the investment banking industry.  Implications for current and future work are discussed._x000B_",1992,,Joel,Podolny
1199,Organizational Impression Management as a Reciprocal Influence Process:  The Neglected Role of the Organizational Audience,"Recent research on organizational impression management has emphasized that leaders are held responsible not only for managing an organization's actions, they are also expected to explain and make sense of those actions.  When events occur that threaten an organization's image, for example, members of the organizational audience routinely turn to the organization's top management for explanations of such events.  As guardians and promoters of the organization's image, it is their job to provide explanations or interpretations that minimze damage to the organization and its leadership.  Much theory and research has addressed the kinds of strategies used by top management to maintain and protect organizational images.  But little attention has been paid to the role the organizational audience plays in shaping the impression management process.  This paper proposes that impression management is a reciprocal influence process that entails cycles of negotiation between top management and segments of the organization's audience.  We present a conceptual framework that identifies the major elements and phases of this interactive process.  We then identify implications of the framework and suggest how it contributes to theory on organizational impression management.",1992,rmkramer,Linda,Ginzel
1200,Cooperation and Organizational Identification,"Organizational theorists have long recognized the important role cooperation plays in organizations.  However, current theories say little about the antecedents of cooperative behavior in organizations.  In this chapter, I present a conceptual framework for analyzing cooperation derived from social identity theory and social categorization theory.  According to this framework, people are more likely to cooperate with other members of an organization when their identification with the organization is salient.  The framework identifies several psychological processes mediating this link between organizational identification and cooperation, including group-based trust, social attraction, and self-presentational concerns.  The framework also describes a number of structural and psychological determinants of organizational identification.",1992,rmkramer,,
1201,Divided Government and U.S. Trade Policy,"We develop a distributive politics theory of delegation and accomodation in U.S. trade policy.  Congress may choose to delegate trade policymaking authority to the president in order to implement more efficient and less protectionist trade policy outcomes.  However, under divided government, the majority party in Congress may be better off constraining the president's use of delegated authority.  A constrained president is forced to partially accomodate Congressional demands fro more protection._x000B__x000B_We provide empirical support for our theory with two findings.  First, the institutional constraints placed on the president's trade policymaking authority are strengthened in times of divided government and loosened under unified government.  Second, U.S. trade policy is significantly more protectionist under divided than under unified government in the time period 1949-1988.",1992,,Susanne | Sharyn,Lohmann | Ohalloran
1203,The Social Context of Negotiation:  Effects of Social Identify and Accountability on Negotiator Decision Making,"The present research investigates how social identification and interpersonal accountability affect decision making during negotiations.  We hypothesize that when a share social identity is salient and feelings of interpersonal accountability between negotiators are high, negotiators will prefer more equal outcomes cover those that maximize their own gains alone.   To investigate these hypotheses, we conducted a laboratory study.  The study employed a 2 x 2 design, in which we varied the salience of individuals' level of social identification (low versus high) and interpersonal accountability (low versus high).  The results supported the major hypotheses.  The findings of the study are discussed in terms of demonstrating the important influence social context exerts on negotiator judgement and decision making.",1992,rmkramer,Elizabeth | Pamela,Newton | Pommeren
1204,A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Theory of Corporate Disclosure Due to Adverse Selection,"In this paper we examine the determinants of firms' level of voluntary disclosure.  We use analysts' published evaluations of firms' disclosures as a comprehensive measure of disclosure level and use a model of discretionary disclosure to explain cross-sectional variation in this measure.  We provide evidence that firms' disclosure levels are 1) increasing in past, current and future performance as measured by a variety of earnings and return variables, 2) increasing in firm size and decreasing in the volatility of past performance and in the correlation between earnings and returns, and 3) higher for firms issuing securities in the current or future period.  In general, the results are consistent with the predictions of the model.",1992,,Russell | Mark,Lundholm | Lang
1205,"Corporate Conservatism, Herd Behavior and Relative Compensation","This paper demonstrates that in a simple setting with managerial concern for reputation and asymmetric information on ability, most managers may refrain from undertaking innovations which stochastically dominate an industry standard. Common components of uncertainty in outcome lead the market to form inferences of managerial ability based on relative performance. Managers who undertake the industry standard are in turn evaluated with a more accurate benchmark than those innovating. Discontinuities in compensation when performance is low (due to firings) lead managers to have differing valuations of an accurate benchmark, depending on type. We find that very high and very low ability managers are more likely to undertake superior innovations than those of average ability. When the expected improvement under the new action is small, most managers with access to the innovation choose to forgo it in favor of the industry standard.",1992,zwiebel,,
1206,The Liability of Collective Action:  Growth and Change Among Early American Telephone Companies,"The advantages of collective action by organizations are discussed often, but no attention has been paid to the possiblilty that engaging in collective action can make organizations less viable.  In this paper, I explain that a liability of collective action is suffered by members of poorly-coordinated organizational communities.  This might be merely a transitory problem, since organizations could change in order to increase community cohesion.  However, organzational inertia makes such change hazardous, and so retards attempts to rationalize community structure.  These ideas are used to explain why early independent  (non-Bell) teleohone companies, which depended on a collective strategy to provide telephone service, stopped growing after an early heyday.  Models of organizational growth, and of the effects of organizational change on failure, are estimated on a sample of companies from Pennsylvania.  The results suggest that poor coordination of the independent movement was a major reason for its stagnation, and that attempts to resolve the problem increased organizational failure rates.  Also, evidence is found that diffuse competition from the Bell System slowed the growth of independent telephone companies.",1992,fbarnett,,
1207,"Information, Control, and Organizational Structure","This paper investigates how a designer of an organization (referred to as the regulator) should organize a production activity in which two different units produce components and where each unit has private information about its cost.  Three organizational structures are analyzed.  In the first (informational consolidation), the regulator contracts with a consolidated unit  that produces both components.  In the second (informational decentralization), the regulator independently contracts with the producer of each component.  In the third (informational delegation), the regulator contracts with one of the units, which in turn subcontracts with other.  In each case, the regulator's optimal mechanism consisting of payment and output schedules is fully characterized.  Informational consolidation and informational decentralization yield different output schedules.  Under informational decentralization, the optimal output schedule may not depend on the sum of the marginal costs of each components, but  when it does, the regulator strictly prefers informational consolidation to informational decntralization.  Informational delegation is shown to be equivalent to informational decentralization when the regulator can observe the contracting between the units.",1992,dbaron,David,Besanko
1209,"Information, Liquidity and Asset Trading in a Random Matching Game","This paper shows that the extent of information available in the market about a security can crucially affect its liquidity.  Following Kiyotaki and Wright (1989), exchange is modeled as a sequential random matching game.  Agents who want to consume relatively early optimally choose to exchange their initial assets for a new asset that has lower expected payoff but is more liquid in subsequent trading.  This incentive to pay a premium for liquidity is further analyzed by allowing agents to credibly disclose more about their assets at a cost.  Alternative intermediated mechanisms for increasing liquidity such as certification of assets by an investment bank, pooling assets in mutual funds, and introducing commercial banks are also discussed.",1992,,Hugo | Ingrid,Hopenhayn | Werner
1211,Employee Stock Options,"This paper considers the optimal exercise policy for employee stock options taking into account the tax incidence of exercise on both the employee and employer as well as the employee's risk preferences.  A recursive algorithm that determines the optimal exercise policy and option value is presented.  The employee strictly prefers to exercise options before maturity under certain conditions on risk aversion, tax status, and information.  The paper explains whether and when (i) additional payments to the employee from employer improve the after-tax welfare of the employer, and (ii) options are more or less tax efficient than a bonus.  The paper documents two instances in which financial accounting rules appear to influence the adoption and form of tax inducements.",1992,,Steven,Huddart
1212,Delegation and the Regulation of Risk,"It has been argued that U.S. regulatory agencies take an extreme and often inconsistent approach to the regulation of risk:  they tend to overreact to dramatic, well-publicized accidents and disasters.  The standard explanation invokes the existence of a cognitive bias:  individuals tend to overestimate the frequency of low probability events and underestimate the frequency of high probability events._x000B__x000B_This paper explores an alternative hypothesis that does not rely on bounded rationality as an explanation.  We examine whether the over-and underregulation of hazardous activities might be due to some particular features of the political oversight of regulatory agencies.  Their political  principal typically intervenes in response to external signals about the risks associated wtih hazardous activities.  Our analysis suggests that regulatory decisionmaking may be biased in the presence of asymmetric or coarse information flows.  In particular, it implies that low probability hazards will tend to be overregulated, high probability hazards underregulated.",1992,,Hugo | Ingrid,Hopenhayn | Werner
1215,On Volatility of Prices in Arbitrage-Free Markets,"This paper addresses the question of what one can learn from observing cross-sectional and time series variations in the volatility of prices in an arbitrage-free securities market.  We introduce the notions of stochastic derivatives, marginal risk-adjusted growth rates, and marginal risk exposure in a single facotr economy.  Using the martingale characterization of arbitrage-free prices, together with a martinagle representation formula due to Haussmann (18=978), we show that cross sectional variations in volatility can be linked to the marginal risk-adjusted growth rate in the economy and to changes in marginal risk exposure.  We use prices ofoptions on the state variable to compute the stochastic derivative and hence the volatility of any state-contingent claim.  We also study the information content of the term structure of volatility and apply the results to the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) model of interest rates.",1992,,Ayman,Hindy

This paper examines several sources of measurement error and misspecification that might induce biases in such studies.  Although previous inferences are shown to be robust to a failure to construct true returns and to omitted variable bias arising from conditional heteroskedasticity in spot rates, we show that the parameters were not stable over the 1975-1989 sample period.  Estimation that allows for endogenous regime shifts in the parameters demonstrates that deviations form undiasedness were more severe in the 1980's.",1992,,Geert,Bekaert
1220,"Large Shareholder Activism, Risk Sharing, and Financial Market Equilibrium","This paper examines financial market equilibrium in the presence of a large investor, such as a pension fund, who has access to a costly monitoring technology allowing him to affect securities' expected payoffs.  Despite the free-rider problem that arises because small shareholders enjoy the benefits but do not incur the costs of monitoring, risk-sharing considerations lead to equilibria in which monitoring is done even when the large investor is not initially endowed with shares.  We characterize the equilibrium allocations and the monitoring levels under various assumptions about the trading environments.  We show that under certain conditions all investors hold the market portfolio of risky assets even when monitoring is possible.  In other cases the large investor deviates from holding the market portfolio and might carefully engage in monitoring activities that reduce the expected payoffs on the market portfolio.",1992,admati | pfleider,Josef,Zechner
1222,"Public Disclosure, Private Information Collection and Short-Term-Trading",This paper examines how public disclosure affects private information acquisition activity in a market economy.  We analyze a setting where traders with short-term investment horizons are allowed to trade on their private information prior to a public disclosure.  We demonstrate in this setting that public disclosure stimulates investment in private information acquisition.  This result is shown to have implications for the magnitude of the pre-announcement and annoucement price reactions to the disclosure.,1992,fmcnich,Brett,Trueman
1224,Home Bias and the Globalization of Securities Markets,"This aper documents the available evidence on international portfolio investment in five OECD countries.  We draw three conclusions from the data. First, there is strong evidence of a home bias in national investment portfolios despite the potential gains from international diversification.  Second, to the extent investors hold international securites, the composition of the portfolio of foreign securities seems to reflect factors other than diversification of risk.  Third, the high volume of cross-border capital flows and the high turnover rate on frieign equity investments relative to domestic equity markets suggests that trnsactions costs and incomplete information are unlikely to be important deterrents to international investment.  These observations suggest that a richer set of models is required to account for international investment behavior.",1992,,Linda | Ingrid,Tesar | Werner
1226,The Time-Variation of Expected Returns and Volatility in Foreign Exchange Markets,"This paper documents and analyzes the time-variation in conditional means and variances of monthly and quartely excess dollar returns on Euroyen, -pound and -mark investments.  A vector autoregressive framework with weekly sampled data on exchange rate changes and forward premiums of the three currencies is used.  Implications for cross-rates are derived as well.  The most recent weekly change in the spot exchange rate is shown to have more predictive power for future exchange rate changes than other components of past monthly or quarterly exchange rate changes.  An increase of the forward premium on the yen, mark or pound signals lower future forward market returns on all three currencies.  Moreover, past second moments of forward premiums predict the volatility of exchange rates.  Ex ante forward market returns are very variable and persistent.  Using a nonlinear Wald test, the hypothesis that expected forward market returns pair-wise move perfectly together could never be rejected.  However, the implied correlation between the yen expected return and expected returns on the European currencies is substantially weakeer than between the European currencies' expected returns themselves.",1992,,Geert,Bekaert
1227,The Dynamics of Competitive Intensity,"Organizations have different competitive abilities.  Theory predicts that this variation will follow a general pattern:  whether through learning or selection, older organizations -- on average -- will have greater competitive strength.  Furthermore, it is predicted that organizations inherit the competitive strengths of their ancestors.  The density-dependent model of population development is generalized to include these effects, and the theory is supported by estimates of the rates of organizational founding and failure for populations of breweries and telephone companies.  The results show that intensity of competition generated by organizations follows a predictable pattern, increasing with an organization's experience as well as the experience of its ancestors.  Implications are discussed, including that the theory accounts for the persistent tendency of organizational populations to become concentrated late in their histories.",1992,fbarnett,,
1229,Comparing Equilibria,"We develop an ordinal approach to comparing the equilibria of economic models.  The main advantages of this approach, compared to the traditional approach based on signing derivatives, are that (1) it ultilizes only a subset of the assumptions traditonally made, resulting in a simpler theory, (2) it applies to discrete changes and even when there are multiple equilibria and when some equilibria do not vary smoothly with the parameters, and (3) it incorporates a formal theory of the robustness of conclusions to assumptions, which helps modelers distinguish which assumptions are ""critical"" to their comparative statics conclusions",1992,milgrom | jroberts,,

THey do not show a general belief in cognitive dissonance effects.

According to the Michigan model, voters have long-standing psychological ties to political parties, but particular elections can be decided by short-term forces such as issues and candidates.  More recently, the hypothesis of retrospective voting (key 1966; Kramer 1971; Fiorina 1981) has found some empirical support in U.S. presidential elections, while the hypothesis of moderating elections (Alesina and Rosenthal 1989) rationalizes the empirical regularity of the midterm Congressional cycle.

1233,Fading Memories:  A Process Study of Strategic Business Exit in Dynamic Environments,"The comparative study of the evolution of Intel Corporation's strategic position in two semiconductor memory businesses and in the microprocessor business provides insight in the forces that drive the strategic business exit process in dynamic environments.  Inertial forces caused distinctive competence to diverge from the evolving basis of competitive advantage in the memory business.  Inertial forces also caused official corporate strategy to diverge from strategic actions taken by middle-level managers.  Intel's internal selection environment played a key role in the strategic business exit process by shifting the allocation of scarce manufacturing resources to new and more attractive business opportunities generated by the firm's evolving distinctive competence.  It thereby helped define the strategic context of the microprocessor business and dissolve the strategic context for the memory business.  This, in turn, set the stage for top management to bring official corporate strategy back in line with strategic action.  By offering some insights in the co-evolution of industry-level sources of competitive advantage and firm-level sources of distinctinve competence, and in the mediating role of the internal selection environment, the paper contributes to the development of an evolutionary ecological perspective on strategy.",1992,profrab,George | Bruce,Cogan | Graham

For each market, the intrady patterns for these stocks closely resemble those of otherwise similar, non-cross-listed stocks.  There is a two-hour period each day when cross-listed stocks are traded both in New York and in London.  This overlap is characterized by concentrated trading as private information, orginating in New York, gets incorporated into prices in both markets.  Cross-border competition for orderflow tends to reduce already declining spreads in London.  By contrast, New York specialists maintain high spreads during the overlap.  Overall, the evidence indicates that orderflow for cross-listed securities is segmented.",1995,,Allan | Ingrid,Kleidon | Werner
1235,A Control Theory of Dynamic Capital Structure,"This paper develops a model in which debt serves to constrain inefficient investments of empire building managers due to the consequent control implications of bankruptcy. Unlike related free cash flow models, capital structure is voluntarily chosen by the management, as a credible constraint which ensures sufficient efficiency to prevent takeover challenges. In particular, dynamic capital structure is derived as the optimal response of partially entrenched empire-building managers to control considerations; managers trade off empire building ambitions with the need to retain the empire to realize these ambitions. Such capital structure is dynamically consistent; in the model, managers are free to read just leverage each period. In deriving a dynamic managerial optimal capital structure, a policy of dividend payments coordinated with capital structure decisions follows naturally. Thus unlike free cash flow models, this model can explain why debt-constrained empire-building managers voluntarily choose to pay dividends and do not reverse restrictive debt imposed upon them by others. The model yields implications for debt level, frequency and term structure as a function of outside investment opportunities and the degree of managerial encroachment.",1992,zwiebel,,

1238,Resetting the Clock:  The Dynamics of Organizational Change and Failure,"Theorists disagree sharply about the likelihood and consequences of organzational change.  This paper suggests that when viewed dynamically, change can be both adaptive and disruptive.  Similarily, the same forces that make organizations inert also make them more malleable when viewed over time.  These ideads are supported by dynamic models of organizational failure and change estimated on a population of 1,011 Finnish newspaper organizations over 193 years.  Organizational changes are found to have two consequences.  The first consequence is an immediate increase in the hazard of organizational failure, and the second is an immediate increase in the likelihood of additional changes of the same type.  However timing is important.  In both cases the immediate effect declines over time.  Finally, the effects of change also depend on timing within the organization's life cycle.",1992,fbarnett,Terry | Dawn,Amburgey | Kelly
1241,Benefits of Narrow Business Strategies,"Firms often concentrate on a narrow range of activities and claim to forego other, apparently profitable, opportunities.  This pursuit of narrow strategies is applauded by some academics who study strategic management.  We present two related theoretical models in which firms do indeed benefit from pursuing such narrow strategies.  In these models, a narrow strategy is beneficial because it enables the firm to motivate its employees to search for ways of increasing the profitability of its core activities.  These benefits arise in our model because the incompleteness of contracts precludes offering similar incentives when the firm is involved in many activities.",1992,saloner,Julio,Rotemberg
1243,"Golden Parachutes, Rubber Checks, and Strategic Retirements from the 102nd House","Political scientists have long been interested in the occupational decisions of politicians.  At least two events prior to the 1992 congressional elections brought journalists and the broader public into emotion-rich but data-poor discussions of how and why to achieve greater turnover in Congress.  The House Bank scandal gave rise to standard arguments that voters should ""throw the bums out.""  An initially obscure provision in the Federal Election Campaign Act, which allowed certain grandfathered members personally to pocket their campaign warchests, gave rise to somewhat more sophisticated assertions about ""buying the bums out.""  Using pre-election data on incumbents' decisions to retire or seek reelection, this paper estimates the effects of these special features of the 1992 election while improving upon prior estimates of strategic retirements more generally.  By embedding an explicit occupational choice model into a maximum likelihood equation, we find strong evidence of strategic retirements, and we quantify precisely the turnover that can be attributed to rubber checks and golden parachutes.",1993,krehbiel,Timothy ,Groseclose
1244,"Deference, Extremism, and Interest Group Ratings","A clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of measures of legislative preferences is essential for resolving substantive disputes about the composition of standing committees in legislatures.  In criticizing interest group ratings as measures of legislative preferences, two recent works make important contributions in this regard (Hall and Grofman 1990, Snyder 1992a).  However, some key methodlogical issues remain unclear or unresolved.  This paper first formalizes and inspects Hall and Grofman's claim that interest group ratings bias tests of the preference-outlier hypothesis to no-difference results when noncommittee members treat committee proposals with deference.  It then examines Snyder's model of artificial extremism which leads to a similar conjecture about no-difference results.  Given a formal notion of deference and empirically plausible conditions, Hal and Grofman's claim is shown not to hold.  While Synder's claim (as Snyder also notes) is shown not to hold in general, artifical extremism does tend to produce the conjectured bias on average.  The bias is small, however, and the change that it leads to faulty inferences is also small.",1993,krehbiel,,

1252,Why Do We Observe Minimal Warranties?,"Why is it that some products carry a minimal manufacturer base warranty even though all consumers are risk-averse?  Conventional wisdom suggests that is it is profitable for the manufacturer to offer comprehensive warranties in this setting.  We provide in this paper an explanation for the provision of minimal warranty in markets where all consumers are risk-averse.  Minimal warranties are created by the impact of consumer moral hazard and competition in the insurance after market for the product.  We show that consumers who purchase optional extended warranties from an independent provider of insurance create a significant negative externality on the warranty redemption costs of the manufacturer.  This in turn creates a significant erosion in the manufacturer's profits from warranty insurance.  Consequently, it is in the best interest of the manufacturer to drop the level of warranty coverage provided with the product.  This intuition hold for homogeneous as well as heterogenous markets of consumers.",1993,,Nancy | V.,Lutz | Padmanabhan
1253,Usage Heterogeneity and Extended Service Contracts,"The paper highlights the role of product warranty in segmentation of consumer durable product markets.  The paper demonstrates that consumer moral hazard and heterogeneity in product usage creates variation in reservation prices of the different segments and in their valuation of product warranties.  In this context, the firm by offering a self-selecting menu of product warranties satisfies the warranty demands of the various segments of the population while simulateneously improving its profits.  We analytically characterized the optimal menu an discuss its implementation with the use of optional extended service contracts.  We empirically validate the consumer behavior predictions of the model using date from a survey of new car buyers.",1993,,V.,Padmanabhan
1254,A Role-based Ecology of Technological Change,"In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework to explore why particular technologies become elaborated and extended, while others are forsaken.  The core of the framework is the role-based conception of the technological niche, which is centered around a focal innovation and includes all innovations with which the focal innovation shares a knowledge-based tie.  Given this conception of the niche, the technological status quo is manifested as an interlocking role structure, and the process of technological change can be framed as one of niche entry.  We offer a eries of hypotheses about  the properties of niches that we anticipate will affect the likelihood of niche entry.  We then operationalize the conception of the niche and test our hypotheses using citation data from semiconductor device patents.  Finally, we highlight a connection between technological change and market presence by exploring the impact of patent citations on a firm's sales volume.  Extensions are discussed.",1993,,Joel,Podolny
1255,Organizational Design and Technology Choice with Nonbinding Contracts,"We present a new methodology for studying the general problem of labor contracting within a firm's boundaries where contracts provide only a minimal commitment to wages and employment. Given the peculiar contractual incompleteness of labor contracts, the resulting wages and profits under a large class of complete information bargaining games distort the technological and organizational decisions facing the owner of the firm's capital. We show that in such settings where firms consist of a nexus of nonbinding labor contracts, these decisions are distorted in an economically distinct way compared to the standard neoclassical firm. Among other things, we demonstrate that a firm with a nonbinding contractual basis will, relative to a neoclassical firm, (i) overemploy labor, (ii) underemploy capital, (iii) choose inefficient ""frontload"" technologies, (iv) de-emphasize scale and scope economies, and (v) inefficiently allocate labor across productive assets. We apply our analysis to product market competition, unionization, hierarchical management, and horizontal mergers.",1993,zwiebel,Lars,Stole
1256,Dynamic Price Formation in a Futures Market via Double Auctions,"We report an exploratory study of the process of price formation in a speculative market in the absence of liquidity traders. Traders exchange a futures contract because they interpret information differently. We formulate trading as a sequence of anonymous double auctions and introduce a notion of bounded rationality in which traders use approximate models of market response in forming their bids. We prove existence of a perfect equilibrium in the sequential anonymous auctions game, and show that the equilibrium has a ""no-regret"" property. After learning the market price, a trader regrets neither the bid that he made nor the position that he holds. We show that trading volume is related to changes in the distribution of information in the economy. We also show that volume and expected change in price are related to two different attributes of the pattern of private information flow. Fundamentally, no particular relationship between the time series of these variables is always valid for all futures contracts. This point is emphasized by an example.",1993,,Ayman,Hindy
1257,Industry Diversity Effects on Job Mobility,"Theory has been formulated that proposes research on the effects of industry variables on individual job mobility.  I consider one such proposal -- the possibility that the diversity of organizations affects the rate of job moves within and out of an industry.  I use data on the career histories of a sample of Norwegian men form 1950 to 1971 to look at this effect in combination with organizational and individual determinants of job mobility.  The analyses show effects of organizational diversity, and suggest that the study of diversity may offer new insight on job mobility processes and related outcomes.",1993,,Henrich,Greve
1258,The Effects of Ownership and Control on Tax and Financial Reporting Policy,"Tax systems around the world are designed to raise revenues in an equitable and efficient manner.  While equity and efficiency are defined differently in various tax jurisdictions, most tax systems seek to implement a system of progressive tax rates in a way that promotes stable economic growth and in a way that stimulates socially desirable activities._x000B__x000B_These multiple objectives manifest themselves in tax rates that increase wtih income levels, that change over time, and that vary across different economic activities and tax jurisdictions.  These features of the tax system provide significant incentives for taxpayers to engage in tax planning strategies.  In fact, the ability of the tax system to redirect economic activities in an efficient manner depends upon taxpayer's responsiveness to these incentives.",1993,fwolfson,,
1261,"Deterrence, Reputations and Competitive Cognition","This study examines an aspect of competitive interactions that has attracted increasing research attention:  the relationship between deterrence and competitive reputations.  We build a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of a firm's reputation for being a credible defender of its markets.  Theory and limited empirical evidence suggests afirm with this reputation should deter competitive attacks against it.  We explore how a manager's competitive cognition about her opponents' (1) patterns of activity in the marketplace and (2) previous success can lead her to perceive a competitor as a credible defender.  We test the framework using MBA students in a quasi-field setting, the Markstrat2 simulation game.  The results of the study suggest that reputation deters attack only when the potential attacker considers the target firm a minor competitor.  Managers consider defenders that have previously been successful as credible defenders of their markets.  They also weigh consistency of activity relative to market average in making inferences about credibility.  The study indicates that the deterrence-reputation link is more complex than previous theory and evidence might imply, and suggest considerable promise for a psychological approach to examining competitive interactions.",1994,dbm,Bruce,Clark
1262,Stock Market Crashes,"Stock market crashes, defined as precipitious declines in value for securities that represent a large proportion of wealth (Garber 1992), are rare, difficult to explain, and potentially catastrophic.  During four trading days in the crash of October 1987, the U.S. stock market fell by about thirty percent, wiping out roughly one trillion dollars of equity.  On October 19, alone, Black Mondat, the market fell by over twenty percent.  Roll (1989) documents simultaneous declines in markets around the world, irrespective of the level of technical sophistication, with concurrent panics that evoked memories of 1929 and the Great Depression._x000B__x000B_What causes such events?  Do they signal important failures in the financial system?  Are they the forerunners of macroeconomic difficulties such as the Great Depression?  What are appropriate responses?  Adding to the importance of these questions is the potential for interaction.  For example, although there may be incentives for a quick response such as the Presidential Task Force or Brady Report (1988), the adequacy of the response is clearly tied to how well the causes are understood.",1994,,Allan,Kleidon
1265,Market Rate Versus Fixed Rate Demand Deposits,"In an economy with uninsured banks, market rate deposits are shown to provide services identical to fixed rate deposits without risking banking panics as long as there is not both aggregate uncertainty about liquidity demands and asymmetric information about bank asset quality. However, if both assets and information revealed through market prices. The analysis may explain the evolution of fixed rate deposits before the introduction of deposit insurance. Moreover, it provides currently relevant insights regarding deposit contract forms and deposit insurance.",1993,,Charles,Jacklin
1266,Optimal Consumption and Portfolio Rules with Durability and Habit Formation,"We study a model of consumption choice and portfolio allocation that captures, in two different interpretations, the combined effect of durability of consumption goods and habit formation over service flows from those goods. In a third interpretation, the model captures the idea of a dual purpose commodity. The optimal allocation problem is from the class of free boundary singular control problems. We discuss, formally, necessary and sufficient conditions for a consumption and portfolio policy to be optimal. We also introduce a numerical technique based on approximating the original program by a sequence of discrete parameter Markov chain control problems. We provide convergence results of the value function, the optimal investment policy, and the optimal consumption regions in the approximating discrete control problems to those in the original continuous time dynamic program. We construct numerically the consumption boundary that divides the state space into two regions--one of immediate consumption and the other of abstinence. We show that both the wealth required to start consuming and the optimal fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset are cyclical functions in both the stock of the durable good and the standard of living. This is due to the interaction between the durability and habit formation effects. We also study the effect of the cyclical investment behavior on the equilibrium risk premium in a representative consumer economy.",1993,,Ayman | Chi-fu | Hang,Hindy | Huang | Zhu
1267,Numerical Analysis of a Free-Boundary Singular Control Problem in Financial Economics,"We analyze a numerical scheme for solving the consumption and investment allocation problem studied in a companion paper by Hindy, Huang, and Zhu (1993). For this problem, Bellman's equation is a differential inequality involving a second order partial differential equation with gradient constraints. The solution involves finding a free-boundary at which consumption occurs. We prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution to Bellman's equation. We describe a numerical analysis technique based on Markov chain approximation schemes. We approximate the original continuous time problem by a sequence of discrete parameter Markov chains control problems. We prove that the value functions and the optimal investment policies in the sequence of the approximating control problems converge to the value function and the optimal investment policy, if it exists, of the original problem. We also show that the optimal consumption and abstinence regions in the sequence of approximating problems converge to those in the original problem.",1993,,Ayman | Chi-fu | Hang,Hindy | Huang | Zhu
1268,Returns Policies: An Under Appreciated Marketing Variable,"Returns policies are widely used in the marketing of products and services. That they do much more than provide insurance is, however, not well known. In this paper, we develop a number of other rationales for distributor and consumer returns policies. We develop these motivations through application of insights from various theories in marketing and economics. These rationales are incorporated into a general framework to provide managers with qualitative insights on the adoption and implementation of returns policies. The framework identifies the benefits that returns policies provide to manufacturers, distributors, and customers. We also discuss the consequences of returns policies, and compare them to alternative marketing strategies.",1993,,I. | V. ,Png | Padmanabhan
1269,Dynamic Pricing in Retail Gasoline Markets,"This paper tests for price patterns in retail gasoline markets consistent with those predicted by models of implicit collusion among firms. Recent supergame models show that the highest supportable collusive price is a function of today's profit relative to expected future profit: collusive prices are higher when predictable changes in demand or cost lead firms to expect that collusive profits are increasing rather than declining. Ceteris paribus, collusive profits will be expected to increase when demand is expected to increase and/or costs are expected to decline. Using panel data on sales volume, and retail and wholesale prices in 59 cities over 72 months, we find results consistent with these predictions. Controlling for current demand and input price, the elasticity of current retail margins with respect to expected next-month demand is about 0.38. The elasticity of current margins with respect to next-month wholesale price is about 0.32. The results are inconsistent with inventory effects.",1993,,Severin | Andrea,Borenstein | Shepard
1270,A Theory of Divided and Unified Government,"A spatial theory of unified and divided government yields comparative statements about gridlock--the tendency of policies to remain unchanged in specified governmental and partisan regimes.  An application of the theory to recent political history yields the prediction that the Clinton Administration's prospects for breaking s-called partisan gridlock are bleak.  Under either of two assumptions about party strength, gridlock is shown to be an invevitable theoretical by-product of  heterogeneity of legislative preferences and super-majoritarian legislative and executive institutions.  The institutional features in the analysis are the president's constitutional right to veto and a Senate minority's right to engage in ""extended debate"" (i.e., to participate in filibusters).  Under specified conditions, each of these inhibits the otherwise-impressive convergence of public policies to the legislative median position.  In addition to the broad prediction of unified gridlock, a more specific empirical test is outlined.",1993,krehbiel,,
1273,A Sequential Choice Theory Perspective on Legislative Organization,"This essay presents a sequential choice theory perspective on legislative organization as an alternative to social choice-based theories.  Because of the sequential process of proposal-making and voting, sequential choice theory yields equilibrium predicitions for both particularistic goods programs and unidimensional and multidimensional collective goods programs.  The theory thus does not require legislative organization and procedures to yield stability.  Although a formal theory of the choice of legislative organization is not presented, sequential choice theory allows an assessment of collective and individualistic incentives for the choice of legislative organization and procedures.  For example, the legislature has collective incentives to control individualistic incentives and can do so by allowing amendments to committee proposals.  Sequential choice theory also addresses the durability issue resulting from a present legislature's inability to bind future legislatures.  In the theory legislators strategically position programs to limit future changes.",1993,dbaron,,
1276,The Time Variation of Risk and Return in Foreign Exchange Markets:  A General Equilibrium Perspective,"This paper investigates the statistical properties of high frequency nominal exchange rates and forward premiums in the context of a dynamic two-country general equilibrium model.  Primary focus is on the persistence, variability, leptokurtosis and conditional heteroskedasticity of exchange rates and on the behavior of foreign exchange risk premiums.  The model combines temporal dependencies in preferences with a transaction cost technology that generates a role for model.  Agents in the economy make decisions on a weekly frequency and face shocks which display time-varying uncertainty.  Simulation  results reveal that the model accounts for the statistical properties of exchange rate data much more accurately than previous structural models.",1993,,Geert,Bekaert
1277,Market Integration and Investment Barriers in Emerging Equity Markets,"This paper develops a return-based measure of market integration for 19 emerging equity markets.  It then examines the relationship between that measure, other return characteristics and investment barriers broadly defined.  Although the analysis is exploratory in nature, some clear conclusions emerge.  First, global factors account for a small fraction of the time-variation in expected returns in most countries, and global predictability has declined over time.  Second, the emerging markets exhibit differing degrees of market integration with the U.S.  The differences are not necessarily associated with direct barriers to investment.  For instance, I do not find a significant link between return characteristics and ownership restrictions.  Third, the most important de facto barriers to global equity market integration are:  poor credit ratings, high and variable inflation, exchange rate controls, the lack of a high quality regulatory and accounting framework, the lack of sufficient country funds and/or cross-listed securities, and the limited size of some stock markets.",1993,,Geert,Bekaert
1278,U.S. Equity Investment in Emerging Stock Markets,"This paper examines U.S. equity flows to emerging stock markets in the 1978.1-1991.3 period.  We draw four main conclusions from this analysis.  First, despite the recent increase in U.S. equity investment in emerging stock markets, the U.S. portfolio remains strongly biased toward domestic equities.  Second, of the fraction of the U.S. portfolio that is allocated to foreign equity investment, the share invested in emerging stock markets is roughly in proportion to their share of the global market capitalization value.  Third, the volatility of U.S. transactions in emerging market equities is higher than in other foreign equities.  However, the normalized volatility of U.S. transactions appears to be falling over time and we find no relationship between the volume of U.S. transactions in foreign equity and local turnover rates or volatility of stock returns.  Finally, we find only a weak relationship between U.S. net purchases of foreign equities and financial variables including U.S. and foreign equity returns and U.S. interest rates.",1993,,Linda | Ingrid,Tesar | Werner
1280,Auctions vs. Negotiations,"Which is the more profitable way to sell a company: a public auction or an optimally structured negotiation with a smaller number of bidders? We show that under standard assumptions the public auction is always preferable, even if it forfeits all the seller's negotiating power, including the ability to withdraw the object from sale, provided that it attracts at least one extra bidder. An immediate public auction also dominates negotiating while maintaining the right to hold an auction subsequently with more bidders. The results hold for both the standard independent private values model and a common values model. They suggest that the value of negotiating skill is small relative to the value of additional competition.",1993,jbulow,Paul,Klemperer

The authors develop a psychologically-based set of propositions regareding the antecedents and consequences of an incumbent's reputation for being a credible defender of its markets, particularly the incumbent's reputation for aggressiveness and intelligence.  An experimental test of the propositions suggest that an aggressive reputation can deter potential entrants, and that this reputation can be cultivated by vigorous marketing activity and previous marketplace success.  The incumbent's competitive relationship with the entrant also affects how reputation can lead to deterrence.",1994,dbm,Bruce,Clark
1288,Comment on 'Price Volatility and Volume Spillovers Between the Tokyo and New York Stock Markets,"The paper by Takatoshi Ito and Weng-Ling Lin (henceforth IL) falls in the general category of market microstructure, which includes the structure of markets, the causes of transaction to transaction price movements, and the way in which information from diverse individuals is aggregated into market prices.  The paper makes two main contributions.  First, it adds to the growing literature that exploits the potential information in the market behavior of assets that are traded in different international markets, but that are identical or at least very similar.  IL examine the behavior of broad market indices in Japan and the United States, namely the Nikkei 225 index from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the S&P 500 index from the NYSE._x000B__x000B_Second, IL provide detailed statistics on price and volume in these markets, including mutual statistical dependencies.  Overnight and daytime returns for several time periods are examined, as are some intraday (hourly) returns during the Crash of October 1987.

1289,Transaction Costs in Dealer Markets:  Evidence from the London Stock Exchange,"New electronic trading technologies have drastically reduced the costs of financial transactions and put tremendous pressure on financial exchanges to lower their costs.  The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is a prominent example of the changes being made in response to this pressure.  In 1986, the LSE switched from a closed, floor-based, broker-dealer market to an open electronic quotation system dubbed SEAQ.  The LSE's SAQ system operates much like the NASD's NASDAQ dealer system.  On SEAQ, competing market makers post bid and ask prices and guaranteed trading volumes.  Although SEAQ also displays trade information, brokers and dealers still negotiate trades by phone.  Besides changing its systems, the LSE enacted new rules designed to encourage competition and narrow quoted spreads.  These included the elimination of fixed commissions and members entry barriers, and the adoption of best execution rules.  The exchange also imposed what it calls mandatory quote volumes.  Mandatory quote volumes require market makers to accept trades equalling two or more percent of a security's average daily trading volume.  To reduce the capital risks associated with large trades, the Exchange granted market makers the right to delay their disclosure.",1994,preiss,Ingrid,Werner
1290,Firm Diversification and CEO Compensation:  Managerial Ability or Executive Entrenchment?,"Data for a sample of 558 CEOs over 1985-1990 suggest substantial compensation premia for managers of diversified firms.  The CEO of a firm with two distinct lines of business averages 10 to 12 percent more in salary and bonus and 13 to 17 percent more in total compensation than the CEO of a similar-sized but undiversified firm, all else is equal.  This corresponds to average salary gains of $115,000 to $145,000 per year for our sample.  This corresponds to aerage salary gains of $115,000 to $145,000 per year for our sample.  Diversification may raise pay because the CEO's job requires higher ability or because it is associated with CEO entrenchment.  If ability explains the correlation, we would expect the diversification premium to be invariant to tenure.  Entrenchment models suggest higher premia for more experienced (more entrenched) CEOs, and an increase in compensation when the CEO diversifies the firm.  The data support an ability model over an entrenchment explanation.  The diversification premium is unaffected by tenure, and increasing diversification reduces compensation for incumbent CEOs, all else equal.",1994,,Nancy | Andrea,Rose | Shepard
1291,Equilibrium Interest Rate and Liquidity Premium with Transaction Costs,"In this paper we study the effects of transaction costs on asset prices. We assume an overlapping generations economy with two riskless assets. The first asset is liquid while the second asset carries proportional transaction costs. We show that agents buy the liquid asset for short-term investment and the illiquid asset for long-term investment. When transaction costs increase, the price of the liquid asset increases. The price of the illiquid asset decreases if the asset is in small supply, but may increase if the supply is large. These results have implications for the effects of transaction taxes and commission deregulation. ",1996,,Dimitri | Jean-Luc,Vayanos | Vila
1292,Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs) and Reform of the Small Group Health Insurance Market,"Small groups face special problems in purchasing health insurance.  Among them, small employees are too small to spread the risks of high medical costs, to achieve economies of scale in administration , to manage competition among accountable health plans, the process needed to drive down costs, or to offer choices of health plan to individual subscribers.  These problems doubtless contribute to the fact that the percentage of employees without employment-based health insurance is much higher in small groups that in large groups.  Solutions to these difficult dilemmas are possible._x000B__x000B_This paper explores the problems faced by small groups in purchasing health insurance, describes the theory behind and the context within which we envision reforms and makes recommendations to resolve the problems of small groups.  We recommend the establishment of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) for self-employed persons and employees of businesses with 100 employees or fewer and their dependents.  This group accounts for 55 percent of the population by some measures, more in some states._x000B__x000B_The HPPC is a pooled purchasing arrangement intended not only to spread risk and achieve economies of scale for small groups, but also to give access to members of small groups to the competitive process available to large groups to drive improvements in qualtiy, reductions in cost.  The HPPC is the institution that creates and perfects the market for small groups, to small to perform these functions for themselves._x000B__x000B_The HPPC spreads risk over its entire sponsored population:  each health plan over its own enrolled members (all of whom pay the same premium for the same coverage from any given plan), and, by risk adjustment, the HPPC spreads the risk among health plans.  It achieves economies of scale in administration.  The HPPC also sets and monitors compliance with rules governing employer behavior, such as underwriting and employer contribution.  The HPPC ""manages competition"" in that is runs an annual enrollment process, standardizes the benefit package (unless state or federal government does that), publishes comparative information on price and quality in a form accessible to and relevant for local purchasers, and does the risk adjustment (unless a state agency does it)._x000B__x000B_The paper also discusses the problems with highly regulatory and voluntary HPPCs, and the advantages of individual choice of plan which the HPPC allows.  Finally, we explore the difficult issues around governance of these new entities._x000B__x000B_The HPPC should be a ""demand side' advocate, representing the interests of employers, employees, and other covered people.  It should actively monitor what is happening, and devise additional procompetitive market-perfecting strategies if health plan or employer behavior makes that necessary.  The HPPC is a ""price taker,"" not a""price maker.""  It does not negotiate prices in the sense that it refuses to deal if the price is not right.  That is for price-conscious consumers to judge.  Finally, HPPCs should not be seen as a regulatory agency, controlling either prices or allocation of capital.  Price controls do not work to reduce costs to consumers.  Given a spending limit, participants would spend the maximum allowed to ensure future spending rights and would apply political pressure to get the maximum increased.  Furthermore, when capital flows through agencies controlled by politicans, the allocation of capital turns into wasteful ""pork barrel,"" allocated to serve the electoral needs of politicans rather than the needs of patients.",1993,enthoven,Sara,Singer
1293,Why Do We Observe Minimal Warranties?,"Why is it that some products carry a minimal manufacturer base warranty even though all consumers are risk-averse? Conventional wisdom suggests that it is profitable for the manufacturer to offer a comprehensive warranty in this setting. We provide in this paper an explanation for the provision of minimal warranty in markets where all consumers are risk-averse. Minimal warranties are created by the impact of consumer moral hazard and competition in the insurance after-market for the product. We show that consumers who purchase optional extended warranties from an independent provider of insurance create a significant negative externality on the warranty redemption costs of the manufacturer. This in turn creates a significant erosion in the manufacturer's profits from warranty insurance. Consequently, it is in the best interest of the manufacturer to drop the level of warranty coverage provided with the product. The intuition holds for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous markets of consumers.",1994,,Nancy | V.,Lutz | Padmanabhan
1294,Manufacturer's Returns Policies and Retail Competition,"Throughout the world, returns policies are widespread in distribution. They are usually justified as a way of insuring retailers against excess inventory. We demonstrate that returns policies can increase manufacturer profitability even in the absence of any insurance motivation. A returns policy enables a manufacturer to influence competition among downstream retailers. Specifically, when primary demand is uncertain, the policy leads to higher retail stocks, less retail price competition, and a higher wholesale price. If production costs are sufficiently low and primary demand uncertainty is not too large, a returns policy will raise the manufacturer's profit.",1994,,I. | V. ,Png | Padmanabhan
1295,Product Introduction Strategy to Signal Network Externality,"The benefits from using a computer software, and hence the willingness of a customer to pay for it, often depends on the number of other customers using the same software. These benefits have been referred to in the literature as ""network externalities"". In addition to application software, network externalities are an important consideration in the marketing of many other high-tech products. We analyze the marketing implications for new product introduction strategies for markets characterized by network externalities. We show that the pattern of the product introduction strategy depends critically on the consumer knowledge of network externalities. A simultaneous launch strategy is optimal for the firm when there is no informational asymmetry between the firm and the consumer about the network externality associated with the product. On the contrary, a sequential launch strategy, wherein the manufacturer launches the product in the first period and then markets upgrades and new releases in subsequent periods, is optimal when consumers are unaware of the externality associated with a product. In this situation, the sequential product introduction strategy becomes a vehicle for information transmission. We show that the consumer can accurately infer the externality associated with the product by observing the launch strategy. This result is derived under conditions of customer heterogeneity. In short, this research posits a potential explanation for sequential product introduction based on efficiency arguments. This is in contrast to arguments that rely on exogenous factors such as technological shocks, quality improvements, cost reductions and/or competitive forces for motivating sequential product introduction.",1994,,Kannan | V.,Srinivasan | Padmanabhan
1296,The Persistence of Real Estate Cycles,"The paper presents a model which attempts to explain the underlying causes of the prolonged cycles observed in real estate markets. In addition, the paper characterizes the features which make some property types more prone to such boom and bust behavior. The combination of demand uncertainty, adjustment costs, and construction lags leads to two phenomena which may help explain market persistence. The first phenomenon is the reluctance of owners to adjust occupancy levels, even in the face of large shifts in renter demand. The second phenomenon is the occurrence of periods of sustained overbuilding; the addition of new supply in the face of already high vacancy rates.",1993,,Steven,Grenadier
1297,Local and National Determinants of Office Vacancies,"A model of vacancy rate determination is estimated using over thirty years of data for twenty U.S. office markets. The variances of individual city office vacancy rates are decomposed into common, time-varying components and city-specific fixed effects. City-specific persistence terms are also included to allow for lagged adjustment towards equilibrium. Three striking results are obtained. First, we find that the level of equilibrium is predominately determined by local, rather than national factors. Second, we find that it is the random shocks causing local deviations from equilibrium which reflect the integration across markets. Specifically, we find significant contemporaneous correlations of shocks across cities. Finally, the results depict a dramatic level of persistence in all markets. The model is then applied to determine whether the experience of the 1980's represented a structural break in the underlying office market structure.",1994,,Steven,Grenadier
1298,Flexibility and Tenant Mix in Real Estate Projects,"This paper presents a model in which owners choose the optimal mix of tenants. Tenant types are broadly defined to include not only the standard distinctions (office, retail, industrial, residential), but also more subtle distinctions such as the nature of business (store type in shopping mall), preferences (high-quality versus no-frills), or degree of credit risk. There are three key features of the model. First, relative rent levels for different tenant types vary stochastically over time. Second, tenant demands for space are interrelated and may produce positive or negative externalities for other tenants. Third, altering the current mix results in the payment of adjustment costs. Using the methods of option pricing theory, the intertemporally optimal tenant mix policy is derived and analyzed. In particular, several factors are identified which impact the degree of landlord ""cautiousness"" in altering the current mix. Finally, the value of the optimal policy is decomposed into two forms of flexibility: dynamic flexibility emanating from the sequence of options to alter the mix in the future, and static flexibility resulting from choosing an initial optimally diversified ""portfolio"" of tenant types.",1994,,Steven,Grenadier
1301,Quota-Based Compensation Plans for Multi-Territory Heterogeneous Salesforces,"A quota plan pays a fixed salary which is supplemented by commission income that is  a prespecified fraction of the dollar sales that exceed the quota.  For a salesforce comprised of multiple salespersons/territories, the commission rate and salary remain the same across salespersons; however, quotas vary across salespersons/territories.  Compared to the optimal curvilnear agency-theory-based plan that is individually tailored to each salesperson/territory, the quota-based plan's total nonoptimality (in profit terms) has two components:  (i) a shpare-induced nonoptimality arising from the fact that the quota-based plan, and (ii) a heterogeneity- induced nonoptimality arising from the fact that the salary and commission rate in the quota plan are constrained to be the same across the salesforce.  Our numerical experiments indicate that the total nonoptimality is merely about 1% for the parametric scenarios studied.  The quota-based plan is simpler to implement than the curvilinear agency-theory-based plan.  Furthermore, changes in business conditions in a territory, or the transfer of a salesperson from one territory to another, can be accomodated by changing only the quota, without having to change the salary and the commission rate structure.  Such advantages, together with the result that the nonoptimality is slight, may explain the prevalence of quota-based plans.  We also provide directional guidelines in terms of how the quota should vary as a function of salesperson and territory characteristics.",1994,seenu,Jagmohan,Raju
1304,"A Theory of Forward Buying, Merchandising and Trade Deals","Manufacturer supported trade deals remain one of the major competitive tools in today's market place.  This is true despite the fact that such trade deals are often claimed to be unprofitable for manufacturers.  The unprofitability is attributed to the fact that  retailers forwardbuy and do not pass the price discounts on to the consumers.  This paper studies the competitive nature of trade promotions by involving all three levels of the distribution system (manufacturers, retailers, and customers) and by modeling the dynamic effects of forward buying by retailers.  We find that in equilibrium, manufacturers will sometimes offer trade promotions even though the retailers do not pass through these deals to the consumers.  Moreover, the retail trade will sometimes accept trade deals, commit to retail merchandising, and forward buy.  Furthermore, as observed in practice, the retailer tends to take turns merchandising brands of the different manufacturers because this enables the retailer to buy a larger number of units at a lower price.  Finally, and most importantly, we show that manufacturers are better off in allowing retailers to forward buy.  In this way, we provide a more complete explanation for the phenomenon of trade deals, as observed, both at the wholesale and retail level.",1994,,John | Miguel,Little | Villas-Boas

It can also lead to the redesign of management control systems to measure how progress on these variables is translated into improvement in quality levels._x000B__x000B_This paper examines quality improvement rates (QIR's) in the electronics industry.  One ojbective is to examine the extent to which learning rates can be explained by experience related variables (such as production volume).  A second objective is to begin identifying factors (other than production volume) which influence the quality improvement rate.  These factors are a starting point in building a richer theory of ""quality learning"" than is provided by existing production-volume based (""learning by doing"") models._x000B__x000B_The paper is arranged as follows:  Section 1 presents a framework for different categories of quality improvement drivers.  The framework draws on the prior literature and more recent writings on manufacturing strategy. Section 2 overviews prior research that relates to quality improvement rates._x000B__x000B_Our research design to analyzing quality drivers is triangular -- a combination of surveys, data analysis and company interviews.  Section 3 reports on perceived drivers of quality from a questionnarie sent to quality engineers and managers in the electronics industry.  Section 4 analyzes quality improvement rates and their possible determinants at Solectron, a company that assembles printed circuit boards.  Solectron received the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award whilst our research was in progress.  Additional evidence from interviews with Solectron personnel are provided in Section 5.  Section 6 presents implications of the research and possible extensions.",1994,gfoster,Leif,Sjoblom
1309,"Marketing, Cost Management and Management Accounting","Marketing costs respresent a significantly large component of the cost structure in many industries.  Relative to research on manufacturing costs, however, marketing costs have received very little attention in the accounting literature.  In the marketing literature, analyses of marketing function have primarily focused on the effects of marketing functions on sales volume and revenues.  In this paper, we highlight a need for understanding the nature of marketing costs and for developing measures that can evaluate both the efficiency and cost effectiveness of marketing functions.  We provide a discussion that links marketing with cost management/management accounting using:  (a) a review of the intersection between the marketing and accounting literatures, (b) field-interviews with marketing executives, and (iii) results from a questionnaire survey of marketing executives.  Significant gaps are perceived to exist between the usefulness of information available from existing accounting systems and the potential value of accounting information in marketing decisions.  Eight areas of future research on the interface between marketing and accounting are discussed.",1994,gfoster,Mahendra,Gupta
1311,"Warranties, Extended Warranties, and Product Quality","We analyze the effect of extended warranties on manufacturer's warranty policy under conditions of producer moral hazard.  When all consumers in the market are identical, the manufacturer offers a full warranty, blockading entry into the insurance market.  If consumers differ in their valuations of working unit, then the manufacturer offers partial warranties (and low quality) to low valuation consumers, and full warranties (and high quality) to high valuation consumers.  This creates an opportunity for entry into the insurance market.  The entering insurer sells extended warranties to low valuation consumers.  In response, the manufacturers changes the menu if offers to consumers.  It sells high valuation consumers a high quality product with a full warranty, at a lower price.  The manufacturer may increase or decrease the warranty, price and quality that it offers low valuation consumers.",1994,,Nancy | V.,Lutz | Padmanabhan
1312,A Dynamic Theory of Collective Goods Programs,"A collective goods program, such as an entitlement program distributes benefits and costs according to constutents' characteristics, and many such programs are outside the appropriations process and continue in effect until changed by future legislation.  This paper presents a dynamic theory of the legislative choice of collective goods programs based on a sequential model representing proposal-making and voting in a majority-rule legislature where the status quo for a session is given by the program last enacted.  A stationary Markov perfect equilibrium is characterized for a unidimensional collectivegoods program and yields a generalized median voter theorem, comparative statics on preferences and legislative procedures, and a characterization of the dynamics of such programs.  Equilibrium programs can expand or contract over time, but they ultimately converge to the median.  On the path to that point, legislators ct strategically to addess the durability problem-that a future legislature can undo the actions of the present legislature-by strategically positioning the status quo to limit the changes tht future legislatures can make.  Multidimensional collective goods programs are also considered, and properties of their equilibria are discussed.",1994,dbaron,,
1314,Organizational Change,Organizational change can be usefully conceptualized in terms of both its process and its content.  Process refers to how change occurs.  Content describes what actually changes in the organization.  Theories and analyzes of organizational change seek to explain why organizations change as well as the consequences of change.  Empirical evidence on both questions is fragmentary and ocasionally contradicotry.  Models that consider both process and content show the greatest potential for resolving this situation.  Such models can be used to test social science theories as well as to evaluate programs of organizational change promulgated by consultants and practitioners.  Basic organizational theory would be enhanced by greater attention to organizational change.,1994,fbarnett | gcarroll,,
1316,Time-Varying World Market Integration,"We propose a conditional measure of capital market integration that allows us to characterize both the cross-section and time-series of expected returns in developed and emerging markets.  Our measure, which arises from a conditional regime-switching model, allows us to describe expected returns in countries that are segmented from world capital markets in one part of the sample and become integrated later in the sample.  Our results suggest that a number of emerging markets exhibit time-varying integration.  Interestingly, some markets appear to be more integrated than one might expect based on prior knowledge of investment restrictions.  Other markets appear segmented even though foreigners have relatively free access to their capital markets.",1994,,Geert,Bekaert
1321,An Evolutionary Model of Organizational Performance,"Organizations vary in how well they perform.  This can be due to differences in their strategic positions and to differences in their competitive abilities.  We propose an evolutionary model in which there is a trade off between these two sources of advantage.  In a naive evolutionary model, competition triggers both selectionand learning -- leaving organizations with the capabilities to perform better.  However, managers often buffer their organizations form the disciplining forces of selection by seeking out positional advantages in the market.  We argue that when this is done using multi-unit structures, market position improves but organizational learning is retarded.  Consistent with this view, we find that after controlling for selection, single-unit organizations benefit today from being exposed historically to competition -- evidence of learning -- while large, ,ulti-unit organiztions do not.  Multi-unit organizations instead benefit form mutual forbearance, a positional advantage.  The findings come from a dynamic analysis of takeovers and performance among retail banks in Illinois.  Implications for the study of strategic evoultion are discussed.",1994,fbarnett,Henrich | Douglas,Greve | Park
1323,Overt Interfunctional Conflict (and its Avoidance through Business Strategy),"We study why functional departments within companies, such as the marketing and manufacturing departments, have different preferences regarding what their firm should do.  We then analyze why these disagreements lead to overt conflict.  Finally, we consider two methods for averting conflict.  The first involves a change in compensation policies while the second involves concentrating innovative talent in one department.  The latter might give rise to ""manufacturing dominant"" or ""marketing dominant"" organizations, or the adoption of a ""low cost"" or ""differentiation"" strategy.",1994,saloner,Julio,Rotemberg
1324,Intrafirm Bargaining Under Nonbinding Contracts,"We present a new methodology for studying the problem of intrafirm bargaining, based on the notion that contracts cannot commit the firm and its agents to wages and employment. In particular, we analyze a general bargaining game between the firm and its employees and look for an outcome which is immune to renegotiations by any party. We demonstrate that the resulting wages and profits under a large class of complete information bargaining games distort the input and organizational decisions facing the owner of the firm's capital. Furthermore, these distortions from the standard neoclassical paradigm have a form which is both intuitively appealing and economically significant.",1994,zwiebel,Lars,Stole
1325,Organizational Design and Technology Choice Under Intrafirm Bargaining,"We consider a wide number of applications of an intrafirm bargaining game within organizations where employees and the owner of a firm's assets engage in wage negotiations. Under our presumption that contracts cannot serve to bind employees to the organization, the resulting stable wage and profit profiles give rise to an objective function for the firm that places weight on intramarginal profits in an economically significant manner. We in turn employ this methodology to explore applications of organizational design, hiring and capital decisions, training and cross-training, the importance of labor and asset specificity, managerial hierarchies, the firm's preference for unionization, responses to competition, and internal capital budgeting.",1994,zwiebel,Lars,Stole
1326,Block Investment and Partial Benefits of Corporate Control,"Despite familiar arguments for diversification, many investors choose to hold significant blocks of equity in the same firm. While control benefits may explain majority blocks, most blocks are much smaller than what is generally considered necessary for control. This paper develops a theory whereby such blocks can confer to their holders partial benefits of control; in particular, small block shareholders can join together and form controlling coalitions. The implications of such a cooperative game among block shareholders for the shareholder structure within and across firms are examined. This paper predicts large investors will ""create their own space"" by staking out large enough blocks to deter other block investors, that there will be a threshold level above which large investors are not challenged, and that the shareholder structure across firms will exhibit a particular clientele effect among block shareholders. These predictions are consistent with a preliminary review of empirical evidence.",1994,zwiebel,,
1328,Product and Process Flexibility: Implications for Organizational Design,"In this paper, we study the interaction between a firm's internal organizational design, which we treat as an irreversible technology choice, and its external environment. We focus on two internal organizational design variables: product design flexibility and process flexibility. Along a given dimension, flexibility lowers the future cost of adjusting production decisions in response to changes in the external environment. Product design adjustments affect the demand for the firm's products, while process adjustments lower the firm's production costs. Our analysis reveals that these two types of adjustments are complementary in terms of increasing the firm's net revenue in a given period. However, we argue that in terms of the initial organizational design costs, there are tradeoffs between product design flexibility and process flexibility. The complementarities between product design and process adjustment compete with the tradeoffs between product design and process flexibility. We find that, due to these competing effects, an increase in the expected future returns to adjustment in a given dimension does not always lead to an increase in the optimal choice of flexibility in that dimension. Thus, our paper draws substantively different conclusions than those which would be reached from a model with only one dimension of flexibility, or from a model that neglected the interactions which arise in terms of either (i) the costs of internal organizational design decisions, or (ii) the benefits to adjusting production decisions.",1994,athey,Armin,Schmutzler
1329,The Vertical Organization of Industry: Systems Competition Versus Component Competition,"We discuss two contrasting styles of vertical organization of an industry with complementary activities or components: systems competition versus component competition. When firm's competencies differ, systems competition is not a perfect substitute for component competition, even with Bertrand behavior. Costs, prices, industry profits, and the distribution of those profits among firms all differ between the two styles of organization. Firms' profit incentives do not generally guide them towards the socially efficient form of vertical organization. In duopoly, there is a bias towards open organization (component competition), but with enough firms (three or more, in an exponential example) this bias is reversed.",1994,saloner,Hunter | Joseph,Monroe | Farrell
1330,"Diversification, Integration and Emerging Market Closed-End Funds","Using an extensive new data set on U.S. and U.K.-traded closed-end funds, we examine the diversification benefits from emerging equity markets and the extent of their integration with global capital markets.  To measure diversification benefits, we exploit the duality between Hansen-Jagannathan bounds (1991) and mean-standard deviation frontiers.  We find significant diversification benefits for the U.K. coutnry funds, but not for the U.S. funds.  The difference appears to relate to differences in portfolio holdings.  To investigate global market integration, we compute the reductio in expected return an investor would be willing to accept to avoid investment barriers in six countries.  We find evidence of investment restrictions for Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand, but not for Korea, the Philippines or Turkey.",1994,,Michael | Geert,Urias | Bekaert
1331,Initial Retrieval Difficulty and Subsequent Recall in an Advertising Setting,"This research examines the proposition that the difficulty encountered during initial retrievals from memory is positively associated with subsequent recall ability.  This proposition is tested experimentally by examining the longitudinal effects of advertising retrieval cues on memory.  Although these cures initially facilitate recall by activating adbased retrieval routes, they may hinder subsequent recall in two ways.  First, the presence of an ad cue reduces the likelihood of activating and strengthening brand name-based routes which may be useful at delay.  Second, ad cues simplify the retrieval process and lower the amount of effort required for successful retrieval.  As a result, ad-based retrieval routes are not strenghtened as much by use as are brand name-based routes.  Together, these effects suggest that consumer memory traces are most resistant to decay if initial retrieval is successful and occurs without advertising retrieval cues.  An experiment using a 2 (cue at time 1) X 2 (cue at time 2) between subject factorial design provides evidence supporting this prediction.",1995,,Mark | Kevin,Forehand | Keller

1333,Opportunities for Improved Statistical Process Control,"Our Bayesian dynamic programming model builds on existing models to account for inspection delay, choice of keeping production going during inspection and/or restoration, and lot sizing.  We focus on describing how dynamic statistical process control (DSPC) rules can improvie on traditional, static ones.  We explore numerical examples and identify nine opportunities for improvement.  Some of these ideas are well known and strongly supported in the literature.  Other ideas may be less well understood.  Our list includes the following:  Cancel some of the inspections called by an (economically) optimal static rule when starting in control (such as at the beginning of a production runs and following a restoration).  Inspect more frequently than called for by an optimal static rule once inspections begin, and inspect even more frequently than that when negative evidence is accumulated.  Utilize evidence from previous inspections to justify either restoration or another inspection.  Cancel  inspections and hesitate to restore the process at the end of a production run.  Consider using scheduled restoration, in which restoration is carried out regardless of the results of any inspections.  Implementation, limitations, and extensions are addressed.",1995,eporteus,Alexander,Angelus
1334,Sources of Cooperation in the One-shot Prisoner's Dilemma:  Distinguishing Between Casual Illusion and Ethical Obligation,"Decisions to cooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma may stem from ethical obligation.  Alternatively, they may reflect illusory attempts to casually influence the other player's decision.  The heuristic processes would be differentially cued by the timing of the other player's decision:  Ethical obligation is less likely when the other's decision lies inthe future; casual illusion is less likely when it lies in the past.  Experiments 1 and 2 investigated this distinction in frequencies of decision patterns indicative of each heuristic across a timing manipulation.  Experiment 3 contrasted prediction and postdiction probability judgments to provide further evidence for casual illusions.",1995,,Michael | Damien | Vittorio,Morris | Sim | Girotto
1335,Perceiving Competitive Reactions:  The Value of Accuracy (and Paranoia),"An assumption of much of the literature in marketing strategy is that firm accurately knows the nature of its interaction with competitors.  This study examines this assumption, and explores the relationship between firm performance and accuracy in perception.  Teams in the Markstrat2 simulation game reported their reactions to competitors, while simultaneously indicating  their perceptions of whether competitors had reacted to their decisions in the past.  Teams were in general inaccurrate in identifying competitive reactions.  Further, missing a competitive reaction (not perceiving a competitor's state reaction)  significantly reduced a team's performance.  The data suggest that teams may benefit from being paranoid about their competitors; late in the game, the more competitive reactions a team perceived to its moves, the better the firm performed, regardless of accuracy.",1995,dbm,Bruce,Clark
1336,The Effect of New Product Features on Brand Choice,"Companies often introduce new product features in order to differentiate their brands and gain a competitive advantage.  In this research we investigate factors that moderates the impact of a new feature on brand choice.  Building on two principles, referred to as multiattribute diminishing sensitivity and performance uncertainty, we propose that the characteristics of the products to which new features are added are important determinants of the impact of these features on sales and market share.  Specifically, in six studies we show that a new feature adds greater value and increases the choice share of brand more when (1) the brand has relatively inferior existing features, (2) the brand is associated with lower (perceived) quality, (3) the brand has a higher price, and (4) the brand has both higher price and higher quality.  The results also suggest that (1) the addition of a new feature reduces buyers' price sensitively for lower quality but not for higher quality brands, and (2) multiattribute diminishing sensitivity is a more important moderator of the effect of new features than performance uncertainty.  We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",1995,itamars,Stephen,Nowlis
1337,The Effect of Choice Set Composition on Consumer Response To Sales Promotions,"Recent research suggests that the response to sales promotion depends on the price-quality tier of the promoting brand, with high-tier brands tending to gain more share than lower-tier brands (e.g., Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989)  We examine the effect of the choice set composition on this asymmetry in response to promotions and, more generally, on the likelihood of brand switching.  Specifically, building on research indicating that a brand at an intermediate price-quality tier tends to take more share from a low-tier brand than from a high-tier brand, we propose that the asymmetric response to promotions will be eliminated when consumers consider three, rather than two, brands at different price-quality tiers.  Furthermore, the addition of an ""extreme"" option (e.g., a high-tier national brand such as Bounty paper towel) to a two-option choice set is expected to increasew the absolute response to promotions on the lower-tier existing brand (e.g., a store brand) and decrease the response to promotions on the high-tier existing brand (e.g., a mid-tier national brand such as Brawny paper towel).  The results of four studeis supported these hypotheses and also demonstrated that the same pattern of effects is observed for different model-tiers of a particular brand.  The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",1995,itamars,Stephen,Nowlis
1339,Preference Reversals Between Consumer Choices and Ratings of Purchase Likelihood,"We propose that consumers' preferences for brands are systematically affected by whether they make direct choices between the brands or rate them separately in terms of purchase likelihood.  Specifically, preference reversals are expected such that low quality, low price brands and low quality brands that have unique product features are preferred more in choice whereas high quality, high price brands are preferred more in ratings.  These predictions are derived from an analysis of the differences between choice and ratings and the compatability between these taks and the attribues of the considered options.  Binary choice often involves within-attitude comparisons and accross-attribute comparisons of intervals (e.g., whether the difference between a Sony TV and a Magnavox TV is worth ($100), which is expected to enhance the importance of attributes that produce precise and unambiguous differences (e.g., price) relative to more complex, qualitative attributes that are more difficult to compare (e.g., price) relative to more complex, qualitative attribute that are more difficult to compare (e.g, brand names).  In a rating task, on the other hand, brand names may often serve as powerful cues, and the cost of a better brand name in terms of price and features is less salient and more difficult to detect.  The predicted preference reversals were supported in six studies, which also examined several rival explanations.  We discuss the theoretical implications of this research and explore its consequences for the measurement of buyers' preferences and for marketers' pricing, merchandising, distribution, and communications strategies.",1995,itamars,Stephen,Nowlis
1340,"Resources and Relationships:  Social Networks, Mobility, and Satisfaction in the Workplace","This paper examines how the structure and content of individuals' networks on the job affect intraorganizational mobility and work-related satisfaction.  Consistent with prior research, we find that mobility is enhanced by having large, dense networks for those informal ties oriented toward acquiring information and resources.  However, we argue that studies of networks and organizational careers have overlooked the importance of informal ties in transmitting social identity and normative expectations within organizations, which is facilitated by networks with the opposite features: smaller size and greater density or closure.  We document this interaction between network structure and content in analyses of mobility and work satisfaction among 236 randomly-sampled exempt employees of a high technology firm.  We also show how the effect of tie duration on mobility vary across types of network ties.  The implications of these finds for theory and research on social networks and organizational mobility are discussed.",1995,,Joel | James,Podolny | Baron
1341,Integrated Product Design for Marketability and Manufacturing,"This paper considers the concept selection stage of a new product development process, using as a point of departure previous work in marketing on optimal concept selection utilizing product attribute-based customer preference and product cost models.  We offer empirical support for the need to push beyond these models into more complete ""customer-ready"" prototypes before choosing a concept to commercialize.  Although the correlations between attribute-based predictions on the one hand, and customer preferernces and product costs on the other, are significant and substantial, too much variance is left unexplained t rely on these models in isolation.  This implies that more detailed design work should be performed on several concepts in paralel.  We also provide a road map for concept generation and selection that leverages the unique strengths of marketing, design and manufacturing in developing successful products.",1995,,Kannan,Srinivasan

The more important attributes for each respondent are first identified by the self-explicated approach.  Full-profile conjoint analysis customized to the respondent's more important attributes is then administered.  The conjoint utility function on the limited set of attributes is then combined with the self-explicated utility function on the full set of attributes.  Surprisingly, the self-explicated approach by itself yielded a slightly higher predictive validity than the combined approach.",1995,seenu,Chan,Park
1343,Value-Relevance of Banks' Fair Value Disclosures under SFAS 107,"SFAS 107 fair value estimates are significant in explaining bank share prices beyond book values.  In particular, securities, loans, and long-term debt are value-relevant, although deposits and off-balance sheet items are not.  The core deposit intangible proxy also is value-relevant.  Proxies for default risk and interest  sensitivity also are significant explanatory variables, but their inclusion does not erode the explanatory power of the SFAS 107 variables. The findings also indicate that December 31 share prices partially reflect the SFAS 107 fair value estimates, but using April 30 prices improves their explanatory power, most notably loans.",1995,fbeaver | fbarth,Wayne,Landsman
1344,"International Accounting Differences and Their Relation to Share Prices:  Evidence from U.K., Australian, and Canadian Firms","We synthesze and extend research exploring differences between U.S. and other countreis' GAAP by investigating whether differences between domestic and U.S. GAAP for U.S.-listed U.K., Australian, and Canadian firms are associated with firms' returns and prices.  The accounting differences wer investigate included goodwill, asset revaluations, income taxes, pensions, interest capitalization, foreign currency, and extractive industries accounting.  We conclude that goodwill is priced as an asset; asset revaluations, successful efforts accounting for extractive industries, and immediate recognitiion of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on long-term assets and liabilities generally are uncorrelated with information investors consider relevant; and tax accounting liability methods used in the U.K. and Australia add explanatory power beyond the U.S. deferral method, as does accrual pension accounting beyond Australia's cash-based method, and in some specifications, interest capitalization.  Our findings suggest that the SEC-required GAAP reconciliation reflects information useful to investors for U.K., Australian, and, to a more limited extent, Canadian firms.",1995,fbarth,Greg,Clinch

1347,The Effects of Cross-Sectional Scale Differences on Regression Results in Empirical Accounting Research,"This study investigates coefficient bias and heteroscedasticity resulting from scale differences in accounting levels-based research designs analytically and using simulations based on accounting data.  Findings indicate that including a scale proxy as an independent variable is more effective than deflation at mitigating coefficient bias, even if the proxy is 95 percent correlated with the true scale factor.  In fact deflation can worsen coefficeint bias.  Also, deflation often does not noticeably reduce heteroscedasticity and can decrease estimation efficiency.  WHite (1980) standard errors are close to the true ones in regressions using undeflated variables.  Replicatons of specifications in three recent accounting studies confirm the simulation findings.  The findings suggest that when scale differences are of concern, accounting researchers should include a scale porxy as an independent variable and report inferences based on White standard errors.",1995,fbarth,Sanjay,Kallapur
1349,Emerging Equity Market Volatility,"Returns in emerging capital markets are very different from returns in developed markets.  While most previous research has focused on average returns, we analyze the volatility of the returns in emerging equity markets.  We characterize the time-series of volatility in emerging markets and explore the distributional foundations of the variance process.   Of particular interest is evidence of asymmetries in volatility and the evolution of the variance process after periods of capital market reform.  We shed indirect light on the question of capital market integration by exploring the changing influence of world  factors on the volatility in emerging markets.  Finally, we investigate the cross-section of volatility.  We use measures such as asset concentration, market capitalization to GDP, size of the trade sector, cross-sectional volatility of individual securities within each country, turnover, foreign exchange variability and national credit ratings to characterize why volatility is different across emerging markets.",1995,,Campbell | Geert,Harvey | Bekaert

Findings reveal component value estimates represent large fractions of bond par value and a fundamental components approach to account for corporate debt results in  key financial statement amounts significantly different from those presently recognized.  Component value estimates and financial statement amounts vary significantly with component estimation order.  Thus, bond value estimates potentially meet the FASB's  relevance criterion.  However, estimate variation across component estimation orders and comparisons of estimates to available benchmarks indicate bond value estimates lack reliabilty.",1997,fbarth,Wayne | Richard,Landsman | Rendleman
1354,Deposit Mobilization through Financial Restraint,"In this paper we apply ideas to the specific issue of deposit mobilization.  This issue is central to the debate on financial deepening.  Mobilizing deposits is crucial in many developing countries.  Domestic funds provide a cheap and reliable source of funds for development, which is of great value developing countries, especially when the economy has difficulty raising capital in international markets.  Yet, in many developing countries, there is a considerable amount of savings that are not intermediated through the formal sector.",1995,,Thomas | Kevin | Joseph,Hellmann | Murdock | Stiglitz
1355,Financial Restraint:  Towards a New Paradigm,"This paper examines a set of financial policies, call financial restraint, that address financial market stability and growth in an initial environment of low financial deepening.  Unlike with financial repression, where the government extracts rents from the private sector, financial restraint calls for the government to create rent opportunities in the private secotr.  These rent opportunities induce outcomes that are more efficient than either financial repression or laissez-faire policies.  It is argued that deposit rate controls and restrictions on competition create franchise value in financial markets that curtails moral hazard behavior among financial intermediaries.  Lending rate controls may also increase the efficiency or intermediation by reducing agency cost in loan markets.",1995,,Thomas | Kevin | Joseph,Hellmann | Murdock | Stiglitz
1356,A Unifying Theory of Credit and Equity Rationing in Markets with Adverse Selection,"In their 1981 model, Stiglitz and Weiss demonstrated that there may be credit rationing in markets with adverse selection.  WOrk by Cho and DeMeza and Webb has subsequently shown that rationing would disappear in the 1981 model if entrepreneurs seek funds on a equity market, rather than on a credit market.  Using a different set of assumptions, Myers and Majluf and Greenwald, Stiglitz and Weiss show that equity markets may also feature rationing.  A question that remains is whether the models of credit and equity rationing can be made compatible.  The analysis of DeMeza and Webb suggests that this is not possible in models with one-dimensional asymmetric information.  In this paper we consider a model with two-one-dimensional asymmetric information: entrepreneurs know more about both the expected returns and the risk of their projects.  We examine how entrepreneurs self-select between the credit and equity makret, and ask whether in equilibrium there can be rationing in one or both of these markets.  Our main results is that credit and equity rationing are not only compatible, but in fact that competition between the credit and equity market may give rise to adverse selection that generates these rationing equilibria.",1995,,Thomas | Joseph,Hellmann | Stiglitz

Growths, after all, is heavily dependent on investment, and a significant fraction of all investment flows through financial institutions.  Furthermore, the experience of some countries with financial instability suggests that poor financial policies can have serious consequences.  For example, when the Southern Cone countries liberalized financial markets before achieving macro-economic stability and low inflation, the performance of banks in thoese countries was diastrous.  In the United States, the partial deregulation of the Savings and Loans (S&L) industry resulted in significant gambling and looting of depositors' funds, ultimately costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.",1995,,Thomas | Kevin,Hellmann | Murdock

I examine why, and under what circumstances, entrepreneurs would voluntarily choose to relinquish control.  I show that control may be necessary for the venture capitalists to have incentives to add value to their companies.  Entrepreneurs may give up control and risk being replaced, even if the loss of private benefits under replacement outweighs the monetary benefit to the company.

In the case modeled, the Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) filed a Section 301 petition under U.S. trade law against practices of Fuji Photo Film Company (Fujifilm) in the Japanese distribution system that Kodak alleges constitute trade barriers.  The model has three components.  The market model characterizes the competition between Fujifilm and Kodak, incorporating characteristics descriptive of the demand andmarket structure in Japan.  Enforcement on an international trade agreement focusing on practices in a distribution system are problematic, so the second model characterized the sustainability of concessions obtained through a trade agreement using a repeated game extension of the market model.  The third model characterizes the bargaining between the U.S. and Japanese governments using the preferences induced by the market model and the limits on sustainable concessions characterized in the second model.  The result is a model in which market and nonmarket strategies are integrated in a formal theory of the resolution of trade disputes and the subsequent effects on market competition.",1995,dbaron,,
1364,Strategic Dissonance,"Firms in high-technology industries frequently face the dangers and opportunities associated with strategic inflection points in their development trajectory.  Strategic inflection points (SIPs) are caused by changes in fundamental industry dynamics, winning strategies, and dominant technologies.  SIPs generate strategic dissonance in the organization because they are associated with divergences between the basis of competition and the firm's dinstinctive competence, and between top management's strategic intent and strategic action.  Top management can take advantage of the information generated by strategic dissonance to develop new strategic intent and lead the organization through the turbulence and uncertainty associated with SIPs.  This requires a capacity for strategic recognition on the part of top and senior management.  Strategic recognition is facilitated by an internal selection environment that allocates rersources based on competitive reality and values dissent and debate.  Strategic recognition is the foundation for exerting strategic leadership: encouraging debate and bring debate to a conclusion that realigns the basis of competition and distinctive competence, and strategy and action.",1995,profrab | agrove,,
1365,On Biases in Tests of the Expectations Hypothesis of the Term Structure of Interest Rates,"We document extreme bias and dispersion in the small sample distributions of five standard regression tests of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates.  These biases, derive from the extreme persistence in short interest rates.  We derive approximate analytic expressions for these biases, and we characterize the small-sample distributions of these test statistics under a simple first-order autoregressive data generating process for the short rate.  The biases are also present when the short rate is modeled with amore realistic regime-switching process.  The differences between the small-sample distributions of test statistics and the asymptotic distributions partially reconcile the different inferences drawn when alternative tests are used to evaluate the expectations hypothesis.  In general, the test statistics reject the expectations hypothesis more strongly and uniformly when they are evaluated using the small-sample distributions, as compared to the asymptotic distributions.",1996,,Robert | David | Geert ,Hodrick | Marshall | Bekaert 
1366,Representativeness and the Structure of Counterfactual Thought,"When imagining how an outcome might have turned out differently, people's ""if only"" thoughts consistently focus on some kinds of antecedent events rather than others.  The current research investigates a tendency to select an antecedent based on similarity or representativeness.  We predict a focus on antecedents representatives of the actual outcome or, in other words, unrepresentive of the imagined counterfactual outcome.  In Experiments 1 and 2 subjects were put in the role of a manager who had invested in advertising in several media and then experienced a low sales outcome.  As predicted, when imagining how sales might have been higher subjects' ""if only"" thoughts consistently focused on the advertising media in which the lowest investment had been made.  In Experiments 3 and 4 subjects were put in the role of an athlete reflecting upon her finish in a recent triathalong.  In Experiment 3, we varied the subject's imagined ""target"" outcome (i.e., a better or worse performance) through instructions.  Consistently, ""if only"" throughts focused on the antecedent event that was unrepresentative of the target outcome.  Experiment 4 varied the race strategy described as normal for the athlete.  Subjects focused on the antecedent that was unrepresentative even when this was presented as part of the athlete's normal strategy.  We discuss how this tendency in counterfactual though differs from previously identified tendencies.",1996,,Michael | Damien,Morris | Sim
1367,Stalking Information:  Bayesian Inventory Management with Unobserved Lost Sales,"Retailers are frequently uncertain about the underlying demand distribution of a new product.  When taking the empirical Bayesian approach of Scarf (1959), they simultaneously stock the product over time and learn about the distribution.  Assuming athat unmet demand is lost and unobserved, this learning must be based on observing sales rather than demand, which differs from sales in the event of stockout.  Using the framework and results of Braden and Freimer (1991), the cumulative learning about the underlying demand distribution is captured by two parameters, a shape parameter that reflects the precision with which the underlying demand distribution is known, and a scale parameter that reflects the predicted size of the underlying market.  An important simplification result of Scarf (1960) and Azoury (1985), which allows the scale parameter to be removed from the optimization, is shown to extend to this setting.  We present examples that reveal two interesting phenomena:  (1) The retailer may prefer that customers not buy everything she has stocked, even though doing so would signal a stochastically larger underlying demand distribution, and (2) it can be optimal to drop a product after a period of successful sales.  We also present specific conditions under which the following results hold:  (1) Investment in excess stocks to enhance learning will occur in every dynamic problem, and (2) a product is never dropped after a period of poor sales.  The unit stockout penalty, the number of periods left in the horizon, and the shapre parameter all play key roles in understanding our results.  The model is extended to multiple independent markets whose distributions depend proportionately on a single unknown parameter.  We argue that smaller markets should be given better service as an effective means of acquiring information.",1997,eporteus,Martin,Lariviere
1369,Target Zones and Exchange Rates:  An Empirical Investigation,"In this paper we develop an empirical model of exchange rates in a target zone.  The model is general enough to nest most theoretical and empirical  models in the existing literature.  We find evidence of two types of jumps in exchange rates.  Realignment jumps are those that are associated with the periodic realignments of the target zone and within-the-band jumps are those that can be accommodated within the current target zone.  The exchange rate may jump outside the current target zone band, in the case of a realignment, but when no jump occurs the target zone is credible (there is zero probability of a realignment) and the exchange rate must stay within the band.  We incorporate jumps, in general, by conditioning the distribution of exchange rate changes on a jump variable where the probability and size of a jump vary over time as a function of financial and macro-economic variables.  With this more general model, we revisit the empirical evidence from the European Monetary System regarding the conditional distribution of exchange rate changes, the credibility of the system, and the size of the foreign exchange risk premia.  In contrast to some previous findings, we conclude that the FF/DM rate exhibits considerable non-linearities, relaignments are predictable and the credibility of the system did not increase after 1987.  Moreover, our model implies that the foreign exchange risk priemium becomes large during speculative crises.  A comparison with the Deutschemark/Dollar rate suggets that an explicit target zone does have a noticable affect on the time-series behavior of exchange rates.",1996,,Stephen | Geert,Gray | Bekaert
1371,"Sticky Prices, Inventories, and Market Power in Wholesale Gasoline Markets","We present and test an explanation for lags in the adjustment of wholesale gasoline prices to changes in crude oil prices.  Our simple model with costly adjustment of production and inventories implies that output prices will respond with a lag to cost shocks even in the absence of menu costs, imperfect information, and long-term buyer/seller relationships.  The model predicts that futures prices for gasoline will adjust incompletel to crude oil price shocks occurring close to the expiration date of the futures contract.  We test and confirm this implication.  The model also predicts that firms with market power will choose a different price adjustment path than would perfectly competitive firms.  We examine the responses of prices in 188 local wholesale gasoline markets and find evidence that greater market power leads to slower output price adjustment.",1996,,Severin | Andrea,Borenstein | Shepard
1373,Strategic Alliances:  Constrasting Korean/US Preferences,"This study examines several contrasts and similarities between Korean and US executive approaches to certain aspects of strategic alliances.  The underlying research premise is that better understanding of the typical similarities and differences in strategic approaches between executives from different countries should facilitate more harmonious and successful cross border alliances.  Specifically a sample of Korean and US executives were asked to consider a potential future alliance which they would expect to pursue.  In this context they were asked to identify the time frame they would expect, to prioritize results such as profits, market share, and learning, and to make conjoint trade-offs between six attributes of the potential alliance: 1) what they must give, 2) what they will  get, 3) the home area of a prospective partner,  4) the time frame of the prospective alliance, 5) the degree of competitive overlap between the partners, and 6) the firm's equity position in the partnership.",1996,dbm,Seoil,Chaiy

1375,Predisposing the Decision Maker Versus Framing the Decision:  A Consumer-Manipulation Approach to Dynamic Preference,"The dominant approach to the study of dynamic preference is to generate preference change by manipulating aspects of decision-problem presentation (problem description, task procedure, contextual options).  The predisposing approach instead holds problem presentation constant and manipulates the decision maker's mental state.  Three illustrative studies are outlined here.  The first modified preferences for ambitious consumption by manipulating subjects' consumption energy.  The second modified preferences for immediate consumption by manipulating subjects' hedonic resources.  The third modified preferences for consumption itself by manipulating subjects' situational desire proneness.  Whereas framing probably affects perception, predisposing apparently affects tastes, and so has special significance for the issue of dynamic preference._x000B_",1996,,Brian,Gibbs
1376,Transaction Costs and Asset Prices:  A Dynamic Equilibrium Model,"In this paper we study the effects of transaction costs on asset prices in an overlapping generations economy with a riskless and liquid bond and N risky stocks whose trading is subject to proportional costs.  Quite surprisingly, the price of a stock does not always decrease in its transaction costs.  In fact, the effect of transaction costs on the stock price is small than the present value of transaction costs incurred at intervals of size equal to the stock's minimum holding period.  We also find that a more frequently traded stock is not always more adversely affected by an increase in its transaction costs and that the price of a stock does not always increase when the transaction costs of a more liquid and correlated stock decrease.  Our model is very tractable and closed-form solutions can be obtained.",1996,,Dimitri,Vayanos
1377,Interorganizational Learing:  The Effect of Outcomes on Learning from the Experience of Others,"In this study, we explore the issue of how and when firms respond to other firms' experience with a given practice or structure.  Existing theory has emphasized two ways this occurs:  (1) firms tend to adopt practices that most other firms have adopted; and (2) firms tend to adopt practices that other firms posssessing certain traits have adopted.  To these conditions, we add a third:  firms learn from the outcomes of other firms' actions, and adopt practices that produce positive outcomes for others.  The purpose of this study is to see whether outcomes affect adoption, and if so, under what conditions.  To study this issue, we look at the outcome of others' use of a given investment banking firm -- the premium paid on a acquisition, and test our hypotheses on 539 acquisitions that occurred during 1988-1993.  Results show that outcomes experienced by one firm affect subsequent use of an IBanker or other firms, but only when they are very salient.  We also find evidence that uncertainty and timing affect firm responses to other firms' experience.  Our findings support both neoinstitutional and organizational learning theories, highlight the contextual nature of vicarious learning, and suggest complex dynamics for population level transformations.",1996,,Pamela,Haunschild
1378,Understanding Organizations:  Concepts and Controversies,"We live in an organizational world.  Most of us are born in an organization (a hospital) and our very existence is ratified by government agency that issues a certificate documenting our birth.  When we die, a death certificate will be issued by another public bureaucracy and our passing may be announced in a newspaper organization.  And during the time in between, more than 90  percent of individuals living in the U.S. will earn their livelihoods working for an organization--as contrasted with being self-employed--having been prepared for employment through schooling in educational organizations.  ""Organizations are all around us.  Because of their ubiquity, however, they fade into the background and we need to be reminded of their impact"" (Scott, 1992, p.3).  As Scott (1992, p.4) noted, one of the indicators of the importance of organizations is that with increasing frequency they are ""singled out as the source of many of  the ills besetting contemporary society.""  Today, many of society's assets are managed and controlled by organizations such as banks and mutual funds, ""organized"" religion is an important social force, and community organizations now do things such as providing help for the poor that were at one time done primarily by neighbors and family.  The fact that so much of our lives and our material and social welfare are inextricably bound up with organizations means that it is important to understand how they function and how they can be understood.",1996,pfeff,,
1379,A New Approach to the Regulation of Trading Across Securities Markets,"Trading the same security in more than one market, commonly known as multimarket trading, is becoming an increasingly widespread phenomenon both across and within countries.  For example, the London Stock Exchange, the third largest stock market in the world, launched in January 1996 a plan for ""new electronic trading services"" implementing an advanced computer-based trading system.  This trading system, which will be accessible from anywhere around the globe, will quote prices to buy and sell securities and automatically executive orders at the quoted prices. The London Stock Exchange intends to introduce similar services in the future to European and Asian markets.  This will greatly expand the already prevalent practice of trading stocks that were listed in Continental Europe and the United State in London.",1996,haim,Yakov,Amihud
1380,When do Interlocks Matter?:  Alternate Sources of Information and Interlock Influence,"The purpose of this study is to investigate when director interlocks affect corporate behavior, and how much influence they exert, by studying the conditions under which their influence varies.  Existing theory supports the view that interlocks provide information, which affects firms' adoption of strategies and structures.  If interlocks provide information, their influence should diminish to the extent that alternate sources of information are available.  We measure the effect of three alternate sources of information on the relationship between interlocks and corporate acquisitions.  Results show that wo alternate sources (e.tg., CEO membership in the Business Roundtable) reduce the impact of the interlock, while one source increases it.  We also find that information from similar interlock partners ismore influential than information from dissimilar interlock partners.  Our findings suggest a theory of interorganizational information:  the substitutability and complementarity of multiple information sources affect their influence.  The implications of our study for interlock and information theories are discussed.",1996,,Christine | Pamela,Beckman | Haunsch

On this interpretation, if the base rate fallacy is to be labelled a ""myth,"" then it should be recognized that this label is not necessarily a disparging one.",1996,,Brian,Gibbs
1383,"Conflicts of Interest, Intermediation, and the Pricing of Underwritten Securities","When commercial banks both lend to, and underwrite securities for a firm, does this result in higher or lower prices for the underwritten securities, compared to investment houses' underwritings?  Investment houses have an incentive to underinvest in costly information production.  Banks obtain such information form their lending activities and hence do not have a similar incentive to underproduce information, instead they have an incentive to misrepresent this information because of bad loan exposure to the issuing firm.  The paper models these differing incentives and weighs them against mitigating reputation effects, to determine prices in equilibrium.  It finds conditions where banks' underwritings can result in higher realised prices and derives implications for the pricing differential.  In particular, even when both intermediaries have similar reputations ex-ante, banks are likely to have a pricing advantage when information collection costs are high, e.g., for junior and information sensitive securities.  The paper also examines implicit costs of bank underwriting by quantifying the level of rent extraction by banks.  It finds conditions under which firms go to banks first and then to the public markets, and for banks and investment houses to co-exist.",1996,,Manju,Puri
1384,Bank Underwriting of Debt Securities:  Modern Evidence,"This paper examines recent evidence on the characteristics and pricing of debt securities underwritten by Section 20 subsidiaries (referred to as banks) of  U.S. commercial bank holding companies compared to those underwritten by investment houses.  Our results show that bank underwriting of lower credit rated issues, where the bank retains a significant stake (through its commercial banking affiliate), results in relatively higher prices.  We find no evidence of conflicts of interest in situations where one would expect large conflicts ex-ante e.g., when the purpose of the bank underwriting is to repay existing bank debt.  The results support the conclusion that when banks underwrite debt securities of firms to which they lend (through their commercial banking affiliate) there is a dominant net certification effect present - especially for lower credit rated issues.  We also find that banks bring a relatively larger proportion of smaller sized issues to the market than investment houses.  Thus, contrary to the contention that greater universal banking powers will stunt the availability of finance to smaller firms we find support for the view that bank underwriting is net beneficial to smaller firms.",1996,,Manju | Amar | Anthony,Puri | Gande | Saunders
1385,Comparison of Some AI and Statistical Classification Methods for a Marketing Case,"Recent progress in data processing technology has made the accumulation and systematic organization of large volumes of data a routine activity.  As a result of these developments, there is an increasing need for data-based or data-driven methods of model development.  This paper describes data-driven classification methods and shows that the automatic development and refinement of decision support models is now possible when the machine is given a large (or sometimes even a small) amount of observations that express instances of a certain task domain.  The classifier obtained may be used to build a decision support system, to refine or update an existing system and to understand or improve a decision-making process.  The described AI classification methods are compared with statistical classification methods for a marketing application.  They can act as a basis for data-driven decision support systems that have two basic components:  an automated knowledge module and an advice module or, in different terms, an automated knowledge acquisition/retrieval module and a knowledge processing module.  When these modules are integrated or linked, a decision support system can be created which enables an organization to make better-quality decisions, with reduced variance, probably using fewer people.",1996,dbm,K. | G.,Vanhoff | Swinnen
1388,Misclassification of a Dependent Variable in a Discrete Response Setting,"A dependent variable which is a discrete response causes the estimated coefficients to be inconsistent in a probit or logit model when misclassification is present.  By'misclassification' we mean that the response is reported or recorded in the wrong category; for example, a variable is recorded as a one when it should have the value zero.  This mistake might easily happen in an interview setting where the respondent misunderstands the question or the interviewer simply checks the wrong box.  Other data sources where the researcher suspects measurement error, such as historical data, certainly exist as well.  We show that when a dependent variable is misclassified in a probit or logit setting, the resulting coefficients are biased and inconsistent.  However, the researcher can correct the problem by employing the likelihood function we derive below, an can explicity estimate the extent of misclassification and the unknown slope coefficients which does not depend on an assumed error distribution and is also robust to misclassification of the dependent variable.   Each of these departures from the usual qualitative response model specifications creates inconsistent estimates._x000B__x000B_We apply our methodoly to a commonly used data set, the Current Population Survey, where we consider the probability of individuals changing jobs.  This type of question is well-known for its potential misclassification.  Both our parametric and semiparametric estimates demonstrate conclusively that significant misclassification exists in the sample.  Furthermore, the probability of misclassification is not the same across observed response classes.  A much higher probability exists for misclassification of reported individual job changes than the probability of misclassification of individual who are reported not to have changed jobs.",1994,,Jerry | Fiona,Hausman | Morton
1389,"Barriers to Entry, Brand Advertising, and Generic Entry in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals Industry","This paper examines the entry decisions of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers into markets opened by patent expiration.  In particular, I examine the role of pre-expiration brand advertising to see if it deters generic entry.  Other drug characteristics affect the number of entrants; the most important of these is pre-expiration brand revenue.  Drugs that treat chronic conditions and drugs that are ora solids attract more entry.  The previous literature has assumed advertising is exogenous to the entry decision when analyzing the role of advertising.  The results under this hypothesis indicate that brands may affect generic entry very slightly by advertising before patent expiration, but two opposing effects render the result nearly insignificant.  When instrumented, the coefficient on advertising disappears.  I conclude that brand advertising is not a barrier to entry by generic firms.",1995,,Fiona,Morton
1390,The Strategic Response by Pharmaceutical Firms to the Medicaid Most-Favored-Customer Rules,"In 1990 the Federal Government included a Most Favored Customer (MFC) clause in the contract (OBRA 90) which would govern the prices paid to firms for pharmaceutical products supplied to Medicaid recipients.  The firms had to give Medicaid their ""best"" (lowest) price in some cases, a percentage below average price in others.  Many theoretical models have shown that an MFC rule commits a firm to compete less aggressively in prices.  We might expect prices to rise following the implementation of the MFC rule, yet the work done to date on OBRA 90 has found this result somewhat difficult to show empirically.  I also conclude that the effects of the law are small and relatively weak; however, the results are strongest where the product's characteristics match the incentives in the law.  I find that after the MFC rule was implemented the average price of branded products facing generic competition rose - the median presentation's price rose about 4%.  Brands protected by patents did not significantly increase price.  Generics in concentrated markets should display a strategic response to the brand's adoption of the MFC.  I find suport for the strategic effect; generic firms raise their prices more as their markets become more concentrated.  I find little change in hospital prices.  The results suggest that the MFC rule resulted in higher prices to some non-Medicaid consumers of pharmaceuticals.",1996,,Fiona,Morton
1392,Recycling the Garbage Can:  An Assessment of  the Research Program,"The garbage can theory of organizational choice is one of the best-known innovations in modern organization theory.  Yet it has not received the kind of systematic assessment that it both deserves and needs.  This paper is an attempt to provide that assessment.  In the first part of the paper, we evaluate the early verbal theory and argue that it fails to provide an adequate foundation for scientific progress.  In the second part, we analyze and re-run their well-known computer model and discover that its agents move in lockstep patterns that are strikingly different from the spirit of the verbal theory.  Indeed, the simulation and the theory turn out to be quite incompatible.  In part three, we examine how the authors have built upon these incompatible formulations in developing the theory further.  We assess the promise and performance of this larger research prograrm and find that many of the problems that attended the original article have intensified over time.  We conclude by arguing that a fundamental overhaul is required if the theory is to realize the promise of its intriguing central ideas.",1998,fbendor,Terry | Kenneth,Moe | Shotts
1393,Toeholds and Takeovers,"Part ownership of a takeover target can help a bidder win a takeover auction, often at a low price.  A bidder with a ""toehold"" bids aggressively in a standard ascending auction because its offers are both bids for the remaining shares and asks for its own holdings.  While the direct effect of a toehold on a bidder's strategy may be small, the indirect effect is large in a common value auction.  When a firm bids more aggresively, its competitors face an increased winner's curse and must bid more conservatively.  This allows the toeholder to bid more aggressively still, and so on.  One implication is that a controlling minority shareholder may be immune to outside offers.  The board of a target may increase the expected sale price by allowing a second bidder to buy a toehold on favorable terms, or by running a sealed bid auction.",1996,jbulow,Paul | Ming,Klemperer | Huang

We find that the use of a benchmark, and particularly the types of benchmarks often used benchmark-adjusted compensation schemes are generally inconsistent with optimal risk-sharing and do not lead to the choice of an optimal portfolio for the investor.  Moreover, benchmarks do not help in solving potential contracting problems such as inducing the manager of expend effort or trying to screen out uninformed managers.",1996,admati | pfleider,,
1396,Entry and Predation:  British Shipping Cartels 1879-1929,"I examine the outcomes of cases of entry by merchant shipping lines into established markets around the turn of the century.  These established markets are completely dominated by an incumbent cartel composed of several member shipping lines.  The cartel makes the decision whether or not to begin a price war against the entrant; some entrants are formally admitted to the cartel without any conflict.  I use characteristics of the entrant to predict whether or not the entrant will encounter a price war conditional on entering.  I find that weaker entrants are fought, where ""weaker"" means less financial resources, experience, size, or poor trade conditions.  The empirical results provide support for the ""long purse"" theory of predation.  I discuss qualitative evidence such as predatory intent expressed in correspondence between cartel members which supports the empirical results.  The results are also found t be robust to misclassification of the dependent variable which is a particular concern when dealing with historical data.",1996,,Fiona,Morton
1401,On the Association Between Voluntary Disclosure and Earnings Management,"This paper investigates the extent to which managers use their accounting discretion to reduce the costs associated with voluntary disclosure in general, and with management forecast  errors in particular.  The empirical findings are consistent with the prediction that managers, fearing costly legal actions by shareholders and loss of  reputation for credibility, use positive discretionary accruals to manage reported earnings upward when realized earnings fall below their publicly disclosed earnings projections.  Results also suggest that th magnitude of discretionary accruals for these firms is associated with proxies for expected litigation costs, i.e., the likelihood of a 10b-5 lawsuit and/or the amount of damages potentially awarded to plaintiffs.  Further analysis indicates that the positive discretionary accruals identified for the firms whose managers have overestimated earnings do not seem to reflect the effect of competing earnings management incentives, nor the effect of the potential simultaneity between management's decisions to issue an earnings forecast and to manage reported earnings.  Contrary to the findings for the firms whose managers have overestimated earnings, there is not evidence that managers who have underestimated earnings manage reported earnings downward.  In fact, managers who have underestimated earnings are twice as likely to revise their earnings forecasts than managers who have overestimated earnings, suggesting these managers prefer forecast revision as a way to mitigate their forecasting errors.",1997,kasznik,,

Also as predicted, idle cash is positively related to repurchase announcement likelihood and returns are less positive for such announcements.  Although information asymmetry not associated with intangible assets is negatively related to repurchase likelihood, announcement returns are positively related, as predicted.  Repurchase likelihood is postively related to stock option plan size, as predicted, and contemporaneous divdend increases, but insignificantly related to book-to-market ratios.  Announcement returns are positively related to book-tomarket ratios and negatively related to stock option plan size, as predicted. Increases in intangible assets associated with research and development and decreases in book-to-market ratios and preannouncement returns are significantly related to share repurchase announcement likelihood.",1999,fbarth | fkasznik,,
1403,Modes of Interorganizational Imitation:  The Effects of Outcome Salience and Uncertainty,"Drawing primarily on neoinstitutional and learning theories, we distinguish three distinct modes of selective interorganizational imitation:  frequent imitation, where organizations copy very common practices; trait imitation, where organizations copy practices executed by other organizations with certain features; and outcome imitation, where organizations imitate based on a practice's apparent impact on others.  We investigate whether these limitation modes occur independently, and whether they are affected by outcome salience and contextual uncertainty.  We do this in the context of an important decision:  which investment banker to use as advisor on an acquisition.  Hypotheses are tested on 539 acquisitions that occurred during 1988-1993.  We find that all three imitation modes occur independently, consistent with the idea that both social and technical indicators may drive imitation in a collectivity of organizations.  Only highly salient outcomes, however, sustain outcome imitation, consistent with theories of imperfect learning.  Uncertainty enhances frequency and some trait imitation, but does not enhance outcome imitation.  The results contribute to neoinstitutional theory by highlighting the possible joint operation of social and technical indicators, and by suggesting that imitation can produce diversity in organizational practices.  The study also enriches organizational learning theories by illuminating factors that moderate vicarious learning processes, and by showing asymmetries between learning from success and failure.",1996,,Pamela,Haunschild

Tests using a sample of 396 bankrupt firms and a larger, pooled sample yield inferences consistent with predictions.  Findings are robust to inclusion of controls for industry, size, return-on-equity, and volatility of equity returns.  Equity book value and net income multiples and incremental explanatory power vary predictably across three illustrative industries, selected based on the likely extent of unrecognized intangible assets.",1998,fbeaver | fbarth,Wayne,Landsman
1405,Growth Cycles,"We construct a rational expectations model in which aggregrate growth alternates between a low growth and a high growth state.  When all agents expect growth to be slow, the returns on investment are low and little investment take place.  This slows growth and confirms the prediction that the returns on investment will be low.  But if agents expect fast growth, investment is high, returns are high, and growth is rapid.  This expectational indeterminacy is induced by complementarity between different types of capital goods.  In a growth and agents take full account of these transitions.  The rules that agents need to form rational expectations in this equilibrium are simple.  The equilibrium with growth cycles is stable under the dynamics implied by a correspondingly simple learning rule.",1996,,Paul | George | Seppo,Evans | Romer | Honkapohja
1406,Strategic Business Exit and Corporate Transformation:  Evolving Links of Technology Strategy and Substantive and Generic Corporate Strategies,"The chapter suggests that in high-technology companies the processes involved in strategic business exit and corporate transformation are driven by the evolving links of technology strategy, and substantive and generic corporate strategies.  Technology strategy is likely to drive substantive as well as generic corporate strategies.   As generic and substantive corporate strategies take shape, the relationships between these different strategies become reciprocal.  Over time, misalignment between the technology strategy and substantive corporate strategy can occur as the environment changes.  Generic corporate strategy may be a more enduring driver than substantive corporate strategy because it becomes embedded in the firm's internal selection environment, and helps determine which new technological variations and associated business opportunities are selected and retained in a new substantive corporate strategy.  A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which technology strategy, and substantive and generic corporate strategies interact may add a critical dimension to the general manager's role in high-technology companies.",1996,profrab,George | Bruce,Cogan | Graham
1408,Marketing Information:  A Competitive Analysis,"Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991).  Information is sold under a large variety of forms:  industry reports, consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial and legal professionals, among others._x000B__x000B_This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study competition in the rapidly emerging information sector.  Specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions:  (1) Is competition fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather than traditional goods and services, and - if yes - why?  (2)  What are the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers and regulators)?  (3)  Can we explain some of the observed marketing strategies in the information industry?  As such, the audience of the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested in understanding what is specific about competition in information markets.  Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential for those who faced with the problem of marketing information._x000B__x000B_To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic model that consists of two firms selling information to a population of consumers who are hetergenous in their willingness to pay for the quality of information.  The most important features of the model are the following.  Information products sold by the two firms are modeled as rarndom draws from two normal distributions having equal mean.  The variances of these distributions and their correlated-ness constitutes the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common knowledge.  Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more accurate estimate.  Quality of information is linked to the accuracy of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by the accuracy of each sample as well as by the correlatedness.  Consumers' utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on their inherent utility for quality (taste) and on the total price they payed to acquire information.  Knowing consumer preferrences, frims simulatneously price their information products._x000B__x000B_The main finding of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive structures.  In particular, the qualitative nature of competition changes depending on basic product characteristics.  While traditional products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or the other depending on its position within the same product-attribute space.  Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively with a continuous change in basic production atttribute levels.  The intuition behind this finding is the following.  When purchasing information, consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase from several information sellers.  This is more likely to happen when the reliability of information is low and the sources of information are independent.  Under such conditions information products tend to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is relatively mild.  In the opposite case, when information is reliable and/or sellers' sources are highly correlated, consumers are satisfied after consulting a single cource.  In this case, information products are substitutes and sellers tend to underct each other's prices to induce consumers to choose their brand.  Understanding this discontinuity in competitive structures has important implications for decision makers as very different strategies are optimal under different product characteristics.  Under substitution, tradtional strategies to avoid competition (e.g. differentiation) are recommended.  When the competing",1996,,Philip | Miklos,Parker | Sarvary
1411,Reforming Medicare Before It's Too Late,"The 1995-96 Medicare debate focused on the exhaustion of the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund by the year 2001 as the primary threat to the program.  The Trust Fund is not the real problem.  As the President suggested, that problem could be ""solved: by, for example, moving coverage of home health services from the payroll-tax financed Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund to the general-revenue-financed Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, or other possible fiscal legerdemain.  The real and very serious problem is the long-term growth of the heavy  burden on taxpayers, expecially workers, posed by the alarming growth of Medicare expenses, especially workers, posed by the alarming growth of Medicare expenses, especially after the baby boomers begin to reach age 65, about 14 year from now.

Articles in the financial press have long argued that analysts are reluctant to issue unfavorable investment information, perhaps because they fear jeopardizing potential investment banking business;1   they fear losing access to management as a source of information;2  and/or they seek to generate trading commissions.3   To date, the academic literature has generally suggested that these forces cause analysts to bias their true predictions toward a more optimistic view.  We examine an alternative response to disincentives to disclose negative information, that analysts are more likely to provide forecasts and recommendations for stocks about which their true expectations are favorable.",1997,fmcnich,Patricia,O'Brien

The authors use a judgment experiment to examine this relationship.  In a setting where a potential entrant is already engaged with an incumbent in another market, the study manipulates the incumbent's reputation for aggressiveness and intelligence, and measures the reputational effect on the entrant's perceptions of the new market.  The study shows that an incumbent's reputation for aggressiveness, but not intelligence, makes a market less attractive and more risky to a potential entrant.  Further, reputation has a stronger effect when degree of multimarket contact is high._x000B__x000B_Keywords:  competition, decision making, strategy, perception, market entry",1996,dbm,Bruce,Clark

First, if firms continue to pay their full costs after dropping out (as in standard-setting context), each firm's exit time is independent both of K and the actions of other players.  Second, in the limit in which firms pay no cost after dropping out (as in a natural-oligopoly problem), the field is immediately reduced to N + 1 firms.  Furthermore, we have perfect sorting, so it is always the K - 1 lowests-value players who drop out in zero time, even though each player's value is private information to the player.  We apply our model to politics, explaining the length of time it takes to collect a winning coalition to pass a bill._x000B__x000B_Keywords:  War of Attrition, Auctions, Standards, Natural Monopoly, Oligopoly, ""Twoness"", ""Strategic Independence"", Political Decision Making.",1996,jbulow,Paul,Klemperer

This paper examines drivers of quality improvement in the electronics industry.  One objective is to examine the extent to which traditional learning-curve models explain observed learning rates.  These models underlie most discussion of learning curves in the accounting literature.  A second objective is to develop a richer platform from which to conduct further research on quality improvement drivers._x000B__x000B_A combination of data analysis, company interviews and surveys are employed.

Product Proliferation and Organizational Failure,"When organizations make important changes, such as introducing new products, they may gain strategic advantage but they also experience disruptions.  We argue that these disruptions are especially strong when organizations introduce multiple products simultaneously, leading to a temporary increase in the hazard of organizational failure.  To test this hypothesis, we study the effects of new products introduction on the exit rates of U.S. semiconductor manufacturers.  We find that while growth lowers organizational mortality rates, introducing multiple products initially raises mortality rates.",1997,fbarnett,John,Freeman
1427,"Bundling Information Goods:  Pricing, Profits and Efficiency","We analyze pricing strategies for digital information goods, such as those increasingly available via the Internet.  Because perfect copies such goods can be created and distributed almost costlessly, any single positive price for copies is likely to be socially inefficient.  However, we show that, under certain conditions, a monopolist selling information goods in large bundles instead of individually may substantially reduce this inefficiency.  In addition, the bundling strategy can extract as profits an arbitrarily large fraction of the area under the demand curve for the individual goods while commensurately reducing consumers' surplus._x000B__x000B_The bundling strategy is particularly attractive when the marginal costs of the goods are very low and when  the correlation in the demand for different goods is low.  We also describe the optimal pricing strategies when these conditions do not hold and show how private incentives for bundling can diverge significantly from social incentives.  The predictions of our analysis appear to be consistent with empirical observations of the markets for Internet and on-line content, cable television programming, and copyrighted music.",1996,,Yannis | Erik,Bakos | Brynjolfsson
1432,Faith in Supervision and the Self-Enhancement Bias:  Two Psychological Reason Why Managers Don't Empower Workers,"The present study provides evidence for two psychological processes that may help explain managers' reluctance to use worker empowerment practices such as delegation or self-managing teams:  1) a faith in supervision effect, which reflects the tendency of observers to see work performed under the control of a supervisor as better than identical work done without as much supervision; and 2) a self-enhancement effect, which reflects the tendency of managers to evaluate a work product more highly the more self-involved they are in its production.  Because empowerment practices dilute managers' individualized supervision of work, they can also reduce managers' biased perceptions of work quality.  Support for this argument was obtained in that 1) participants assigned higher quality to the identical work product as supervisory involvement increased, 2) they did so at elevated levels when they had more self-involvement in supervising the work, and 3) a team-based, empowerment orientation curtailed both biases.",1997,pfeff,Robert | Benjamin | Kathleen,Cialdini | Hanna | Knopoff

1437,Comparative Dynamics of Parliamentary Governments,"This paper presents a dynamic theory of parliamentary governments that incorporates attributes o fhte institutional system in a country, exogenous events that shpare parliamentary and electoral opportunities, and the strategies of the government and the opposition as structured by institutions and preferences.  The dynamics are investigated in an infinitely-repeated game in which in each period an event in the form of a shock to income or government resources occurs and the government responds with a legislative proposal that is subject to a confidence or censure procedure and may lead to government continuation,  reqorganization, or dissolution.  This provides a comparative theory of parliamentary governments where the comparison is across procedures for government termination.  With a majority confidence procedure, governments are stable, and if parties are politically patient, voting cohesion within the government is high.  When parties are politically impatient, cohesion is lower since a government party may have an incentive to pursue opportunities with the out party.  A censure or no confidence motion initiated by the opposition can result in voluntary dissolution of government, and the approach of required elections increases the likelihood of dissolution.  If the events represent fluctuations in aggregate income, government dissolution occurs in good times but not in bad times.  This corresponds to the opportunistic calling of an early election.  The theory also predicts that the governments formed are minimal winning coalitions and hence include the smallest party.",1997,dbaron,,

We show that there are two qualitatively very different regimes, determined by the discount rate and the intensities of demand curve switching, and the dependence of the optimal policy on these parameters is discontinuous.  One regime is characteriszed by extreme experimentation and good tracking of the prevailing demand curve,  the other by moderate experimentation and poor tracking.  Moreover, in the latter regime the agent eventually become 'trapped' into taking actions in a strict subset of the feasible set.",1997,,Sven,Rady

1449,Outgroup Favoritism and the Theory of System Justification:  A Paradigm for Studying the Effects of Socio-Economic Status on Stereotypes,"A research paradigm involving real-world group memberships and experimental manipulations of relative socio-economic success is used to support a system justification theory of outgroup favoritism among low status groups (Jost & Banaji, 1994).  Major findings from Studies 1 and 2 were that high success groups exhibited ingroup favoritism and low success groups exhibited outgroup favoritism, expecially when:  (a) perceived legitimacy of the success differences was high rather than low; (b) dimensions of comparison were relevant to the success differences rather than irrelevant; and (c) participants were not asked to explain the success differences rather than when they were.  Content analysis indicated that open-ended explanations for the success differences generated by high success in Study 2 refelcted ingroup favoritism, whereas explanations generated by low success groups reflected outgroup favoritism.  When perceived legitmacy and ingroup identification were manipulated independently in Study 3, low success groups showed outgroup favoritism when perceived legitimacy was high (but not low) and on relevant (but not irrelevant) attributes.  In Study 4, these effects were replicated in the context of a naturally occuring status difference.  Taken as a whole, the evidence provides strong empirical support for a system justification approach to sterotyping and intergroup relations.",1997,,John,Jost
1450,"Social Status, Entry, and Predation:  The Case of British Shipping Cartels 1879-1929","In this paper, we attempt to incorporate social status and regional affiliation -- two variables of central sociological interest -- into an economic analysis.  We build on Scott Morton's (1997) examination of entry and predation in the merchant shipping industry at the turn of the century in which she finds support for the long purse theory.  During the time period in which the entries were occurring, there was a rich social context that the economic model ignores but that likely influenced the result of an entry incident.  We modify the model to take account of social identity and include in the dataset the social status of the entrant owners to see if it has an impact on the predation behavior of the incumbent cartels.  We find that high social status entrants are significantly less likely (40%) to be preyed upon by the incumbent cartel than the low social status entrants.  The result is consistent with social status being a proxy for family wealth (or deep pockets), a consumption good for other cartel members, and an indication of the future cooperativeness of the entrant, or his ability to uphold the 'moral community' of the cartel.  Further analysis provides additional support for the last hypothesis.  The paper highlights the role of social identity as an important factor underlying instances of market conflict; it also illustrates that a straightforward economic model of predation can be improved upon in the both  the theoretical and empirical dimensions with the addition of reasoning and variablables traditionally of concern to other disciplines, which may result  in richer description of behavior.",1997,,Joel,Podolny

These women occupy positions of considerable formal power, yet they are disempowered, in some ways, by their gender.

We also ask whether displays of emotions in organizations need be managed primarily for instrumental purposes, a form of emotional labor which entails costs for employees.  This paper explores the viability of an alternative emotion management approach, which Mumby and Putnam (1992) label bounded emotionality.  We show how bounded emotionality was enacted and explore difficulties in its implementation, including employees who prefer impersonality and the dangers of a deeper and more intimate form of controlling employees.  Rapid firm growth, a limited labor market, and the pressures of a competitive marketplace serve as boundary conditions for the maintenance of bounded emotionality.",1997,jmartin,Christine | Kathleen,Beckman | Knopoff

We find, as predicted, that upwards fixed asset revaluations under U.K. GAAP are significantly positively related to future firm performance.  Also, current year revaluations (revaluation balances) are significantly positively related to contemportaneous stock returns (prices).  These findings indicated revaluation amounts reliablymeasure changes in asset values.  Revaluations before 1990 are more strongly associated with future performance and returns than those after 1990, suggesting the reduction in management discretion embodied in 1990 proposed accounting changes reduced the reliability of revaluation amounts.

Subjects in three studies placed greater relative emphasis on across-group comparisons than within-group comparisons for actors who were atypical for the event compared to actors who were typical, where typicality was operationalized through race of actor.  Subjects' causal explanations also differed by social category, providing more race related explanations for atypical actors than typical actors.

1464,Social Metacognition:  An Expansionist Review,"This paper reviews recent social psychological contributions to the metacognitive movement.  It is argued that social psychologists have long contributed to the study of ""thinking about thinking"", even though their work has not yet been recognized as metacognitive.  The present ""expansionist"" survey suggests that the domain of social metacognition should include: (1) belifefs about one's own mental states and processes as well as beliefs about those of other people, (2) momentary sensations as well as enduring folk theories, and (3) descriptive beliefs about how the mnd works and normative beliefs about how it ought to work.  The contents and origins of metacognitions are inherently social; at the same time, metacognitions are comprised of cognitive elements an are governed by the principles and laws appicable to human thinking in general.  Accordingly, whereas metacognitions about self-knowledge may be derived from different informational sources than metacognitions about other people, the processes whereby different types of metacognitions are formed, activated, and applied are essentially the same.  Focusing on the social nature of metacognition an the profound relevance of cultural expectations on cognitive performance makes clear the benefits of systematically exploring the cognitive/social interface in reference to metacognitive phenomena.",1997,,John | Thomas | Arie,Jost | Nelson | Kruglanski

1473,Asymmetric and Neighborhood Cross-Price Effects:  Joint Estimation for Testing Empirical Generalizability,"This paper provides some empirical generalizations regarding how the relative prices of competing brands affect the corss-price effects between them.  Particular focus is on the asymmetric price effect, which states that the price promotion by a higher-priced brand affects the market share of a lower-priced brand more so than the reverse, and the neighborhood price effect, which states that brands that are closer to each other in price have larger cross-price effects than brands that are priced farther apart.  In addition to the conventional cross-price elasticity measure, we consider the absolute cross-price effect, defind as the change in market share (percentage) points of a target brand when a competing brand's price changes by one-percent of the product category price.  We show that there is an inherent bias in favor of asymmetry in cross-price elasticities and point out  the need for analyzing absolute cross-price effects as well._x000B__x000B_Based on a meta-analysis of 1.060 cross-price effects on 280 brands from 19 different grocery product categories, we provide the following empirical generalizations:_x000B__x000B_-The asymmetric price effect holds with cross-price elasticies, but tends to disappear with absolute cross-price effects._x000B_-The neighborhood price effect holds with both cross-price elasticities and absolute cross-price effects, and is significantly stronger than the asymmetric price effect on both measures of cross-price effects._x000B_-A brand is affected the most by discounts of its immediately higher-priced brand, followed closely by discounts of its immediately lower-priced brand._x000B_-National brands impact store brands more so than the reverse when the cross-effect is measured in elasticities, but the asymmetric effect does not hold with absolute effects.  Store brands hurt and are, in turn, hurt the most by the lower-priced national brands that are adjacent in price to the store brands._x000B_-Cross-price effects are greater when there are fewer competing brands in the product category, and among brands in non-food household product categories than among brands in food products._x000B__x000B_The implications of the findings are discussed.",1998,seenu,Doyle | Raj,Kim | Sethuraman

We also investigate whether they differ if the valuation amount is determined by the firm's Board of Directors or an independent appraiser, for more versus less timely valuations, and for revalued amounts that are above or below historical cost.   We base our inferences on the association between the recognixzed amounts relating to various categories of revalued assets of Australian firms and share prices and non market-based estimates of firm value, which is based on analysts' earnings forecasts.  _x000B__x000B_Our  evidence bears directly on revaluation practices under Australian GAAP, However, our evidence also bears indirectly on current issues facing the Financial Accounting Standards Baord (FASB) in the U.S.   U.S. GAAP requires disclosure, and the FASB is considering requiring recognition, of air values of all financial instruments.  Currently, there is no U.S. proporal to disclose or recognize non-financial instruments.  Currently, there is no U.S. proposal to disclose or recognize non-financial assets at fair value (FASB [1991, 1006]).  Yet, fair values of all assets likely are relevant to financial statement users.  One reason the FASB distinguishes financial and non-financial assets is the belief that fair values are not reliably estimable for non-financial assets, especially intangible assets and tangible assets whose value in use varies from exit or entry value (Landsman and Barth [1995]).  Beacuase AUstralian GAAP permits revaluing all long-lived assets at fair value (and many Australian firms do so). examining Australian revaluations by asset class permits us to test this belief.  Also, Australian GAAP permits revaluations based on independent appraisers' or directors' value estimates, which may differ in reliability, and does not require revaluations every year, possibly affecting relevance and timeliness.  We investigate all of these possibilities.",1998,fbarth,Greg,Clinch

1487,Shopping Behavior and Consumer Preference for Store Price Format:  Why 'Large Basket' Shoppers Prefer EDLP,"In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly competitive.  One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior.  This paper addresses tow new and important questions concerning grocery shopping behavior, retail price format and sotre choice.  First, after controlling for other factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products (""expected basket attractiveness"") influence the store choice decision?  Second, are different pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different types of shoppers?  Specifically, how do market basket decisions and purchase incidence behavior relate to store choice?_x000B__x000B_To answer these questions we develop a theory and empircal analysis of consumer shopping behavior under price uncertainty.  In formulating the theory, we draw on previous work (e.g., Kahn and Schmittlein 1992) and segment shoppers according to their ""expected basked size""  on a shopping trip.  This segmentation allows us to explain preference for EDLP and HILO store formats.  We contend that the large basket shopper who has a higher probability of category purchase (for any given category) will prefer the format with a lower average basket price (EDLP).  Conversely, the small basket shopper with a lower probability of category  purchase (for any given category) will prefer the store with more price variation (HILO), even at higher average prices.  We develop three propositions that formalize this intuition.  A key structural implication of our theory is that large basked shoppers are less responsive to price in their individual category  purchase incidence decisions; this makes them more responsive to the expected total basket price in their store choice decisions.  Furthermore, an increase in the shopper's expected basket size will lead to an increase in preference for EDLP.  In an extension to basic model, we show that for two shoppers with the same expected basked size per trip, but different trip frequencies, the more frequent shoppers will prefer HILO.  _x000B__x000B_We test the propositions using a model of shopping behavior and a market basket scanner panel database from two markets with purchases from 1042 panelists.  We find that even after controlling for  important factors such as household distance to the store, previous experience in the store and advertised specials, price expectations for the basket influence store choice.  Furthermore, EDLP store get a greater than expected share of business from large basket shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small basket shoppers.  Large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice decisions.  Finally, we use model parameters and output to gain additional insight into focal categories that influence price image for the store, and demographic characterisitcs of large and small basket shoppers.",1998,jlattin,David,Bell
1496,Brand Values and Capital Market Valuation,"We find that brand value estimates reported by FinancialWorld are significantly postively related to prices and returns, incremental to other accounting variables.  Concerns about brand value estimate reliability underlie lack of financial statement recognition of brands.  Our findings suggest the estimates are relevant to investors and sufficiently reliable to be reflected in share prices.  Simultaneous equations estimation reveals our inferences are unaffected by potential bias resulting from simultaneity between brand value estimates and equity market value.  Brand value estimates also are positively associated with advertising espense, operating margin, and market share.  Yet, brand value estimates provide significant explanatory power for share prices incremental to these variables, and to recognized brand assets and analysts earnings forecasts.",1998,fbarth | fkasznik | gfoster,Michael,Clement

This study contributes to this literature by examining the characteristics and valuation of an important accural recognized by property casualty insurance companies, the reserve for claim losses.  This accrual reflects management's information about future cash flows that will be required to settle claims on policies written as of the balance sheet date.",1998,fbeaver | fmcnich,,
1510,Culture and Attributions to Individuals Versus Groups:  North Americans Attribute to Personal Dispositions; East Asians Attribute to the Dispositions of Social Collectives,"Cross-cultural studies have found that East Asians are less likely than North Americans to attribute a target person's deviant behavior to personal dispositions.  Our interpretation is that cultures differ in implicit theories of individuals and groups.  North Americans conceive of individual persons as free agents whereas East Asians conceptualize them as constrained members of agentic  social collectives.  Hence, we expected that East Asians would be more likely than North Americans to focus on collective agents and attribute outcomes to their dispositions.  Study 1 analyzed newspaper articles about ""rogue trader"" scandels and found that US papers made more mention of the individual trader involved whereas Japanese papers referred more to the organizations.  Study 2 replicated this pattern among US and Hong Kong participants responding to a vignette about a maladjusted member of a work team.  Study 3 revealed the same pattern with respect to individual and group dispositionism using a different design than compared attributions for an act performed by an individual, in one condition, and by a group, in other condition.",1998,,Michael | Chi-yue | Ying-yi | Tanya ,Morris | Chiu | Hong | Menon

1516,A Dual Perspective Approach to Culture and Organizational Justice:  Interplay Between Insider (Emic) and Outsider (Etic) Views,"Research on cultural influence on organizational behavior can be roughly categorized into two approaches--the emic approach of understanding a specific culture fromthe standpoint of an insider, and the etic approach of understanding casual regularities among cultural dimensions and other variables from an external vantage.  In the current paper, we argue that these two approaches are complementary both in theory development about organizational justice and in practical application.  The two perspectives lead to a general framework of justice judgement that distinguishes the concrete beliefs used to construe behavior from the abstract principles used to connect the observed behavior with a reward or punishment.  This framework not only provides an understanding of two different ways culture affects justice judgement but it also provides practical guidance about the options an organization has in managing organizational justice.",1998,,Michael | Daniel | Kwok | Brian,Morris | Ames | Leung | Lickel
1522,Managing the Delivery of Dialysis Therapy: A Multiclass Fluid Model Analysis,"Motivated by the exceptionally high mortality statistics of dialysis patients and the ongoing debate about the adequacy of the current reimbursement for the dialysis in the United States, we pursue a detailed analysis of the dialysis delivery system.  The analysis is based on a multiclass fluid model for the dialysis facility, which combines a pharmacokinetics model of dialysis and an empirically validated model of dialysis-specific mortality.  Assuming that the facility operates under the budget and capacity constraints, our analysis determines the main factors that affect the delivery of dialysis.  Numerical results, which are representative of the dialysis environment in the US, dmeonstrate the accuracy of the model and provide concrete insights about the operations of the dialysis facility.  A major finding is that an improvement in the technology of dialysis is likely to have a more substantal impact on the overall life expectancy of the dialysis population as compared to an increase in the dialysis reimbursement rate.",1998,stefzen,Prashant,Fuloria
1525,"Bank Entry, Competition and the Market for Corporate Securities Underwriting","This paper examines the competitive effects of recent commercial bank entry into the corporate debt underwriting market.  In particular, the effects of bank entry on underwriter spreads, ex-ante yields, and market concentration.  We find that underwriter spreads have declined significantly with bank entry, consistent with the market becoming more competitive.  This effect is strongest among lower-credit rated and small-sized debt issues where banks have underwritten relatively more issues.  We find a similar decline for ex-ante yields.  The early evidence also indicates that bank entry has tended to decrease market concentration.  Overall, our results suggest that bank entry has had a favorable pro-competitive effect.",1998,,Manju | Amar | Anthony,Puri | Gande | Saunders
1527,Missing Relations: Incorporating Relational Constructs Into Models of Culture,"In this chapter, we argue that a better understanding of how individuals are affected by national culture is achieved when the subjectivist analysis of internal attitudes is supplemented with the structuralist approach of focusing on the external social relations that constrain behavior.  More specifically, we suggest that the concepts developed for studying patterns of social relations are useful in cultural research.  Some relevant relational concepts refer to the form or geometry of an individual's relations.  Destiny, for example, refers to the degree of inter-connectedness among the other people in one's networks, and density has been linked to the cultural difference between ""loosely knit"" and ""tightly knit"" societies (e.g., Fischer & Shavit, 1995).  Other concepts involve the content as well as the form of relations.  Multiplexity, for example, refers to whether one exchanges personal friendship and instrumental resources in the same relationship or not, and this relational dimension has been suggested by several theorists to explain cultural differnces in workplace behavior (e.g., Dore, 1983 Gluckman, 1967).  We review the sparse literature on cross-national differences in relational variables and conclude that there is a great deal of unexplored potential in capturing the differences between cultures in terms of the differeing relations in which individuals are embedded.  However, we also review theoretical arguments against the notion that culture can be reduced to a purely structural analysis.",1998,,Joel,Podolny
1534,Attitudinal Ambivalence and the Conflict Between Group and System Justification Motives in Low Status Groups,"It is argued that members of low status groups are faced with a psychological conflict between group justification tendencies to evaluate members of one's own group favorably and system justification tendencies to endorse the superiority of higher status outgroups.  In Study 1, members of low status groups exhibited less ingroup favoritism and more ingroup ambivalence than did members of high status groups.  Perceptions that the status differences were legitimate increased outgroup favoritism and ambivalence among low status groups, and they increased ingroup favoritism and decreased ambivalence among high status groups.  In Study 2, the ""belief"" in a just world"" and ""social dominance orientation"" increased ambivalence on the part of women toward female victims of gender discrimination, but they decreased ambivalence on the prt of men.  Evidence here indicates that system justifying variables increase ingroup ambivalence among low status group members and they decrease ambivalence among high status group members.",1998,,John | Diana,Jost | Burgess
1538,"Resource Commitment, Entry Timing and Market Performance of Foreign Direct Investments in Emerging Economies:  The Case of Japanese International Joint Ventures in China","As emerging economic regions (EERs) play a significant role in global economies, managers of multinationals have become increasingly aware of the importance of relevant international expansion in these regions.  Facing potential market opportunities, the managers are eager to gain first-mover advantages and build technology leadership in the EERs.  However, given nontrival uncertainties in EERs, the efforts to be first movers and technology leaders in these regions may not result in successful performance.  This study examined whether first movers and technology leaders would attain superior performance in EERs.  Building on the literature on entry strategy, we focused on two key constructs of entry strategy:  resource commitment and timing of entry.  We argued that the former would increase the likelihood that firms gain technology leadership, and the latter is related to first-mover advantages in the local marketplace.  The study examined botht he determinants and (JVs) in China.  The results suggest that both resource commitment and speed of entry had positive impacts on the perceived economic performance of the JVs, suggesting that first movers and technology leaders did attain superior perceived performance in EER markets. Yet, this relationship was found to be significantly contigent upon several internal and external factors, such as the strategic importance of the investment, the extent of parental control within the JV, and the availability of complementary assets.",1998,dbm,Takehiko | Shige,Isobe | Makino
1541,Can Investors Profit from the Prophets?  Consensus Analyst Recommendations and Stock Returns,"In this paper we document that stocks highly recommended by analysts outperform the market, while those that are unfavorably recommended underperform.  Our findings are based on an extensive analysis of over 360,000 analyst recommendations from 269 brokerage houses over the period 1986-1996.  We show that strategies of purchasing the stocks with the most favorable consensus (average) recommendations or selling short those with the least favorable recommendations, in conjunction with daily portfolio rebalancing and a timely response by investors to changes in consensus recommendation, yielded and annual abnormal gross return of more than 4 percent.  Less frequent portfolio rebalancing or a delay in reacting to consensus recommendation changes diminished the abnormal returns; however, they did remain significant for the least favorable rated stocks.  We also show that quite high trading levels are required to capture the excess returns generated by the strategies we analyze, entailing substantial transactions costs and leading to abnormal net returns for these strategies that were not reliably greater than zero.

1545,Social Psychological Obstacles in Environmental Conflict Resolution,"Among the factors contributing to the difficulty in resolving conflicts between environmental and economic interest are the dynamics of perception and decision making studied by social psychologists.  We identify social psychological dynamics that impede parties in environmental dilemmas from understanding facts, understanding interests, and making decisions in favor of efficient conflict settlement.  We review research elucidating the sources of these problems and potential remedies.  Then we discuss how these dynamics play out within the context of procedures typically used to settle environmental conflicts, traditional legislated regulation and alternative market-based procedures.  We conclude that whereas market-based alternatives avoid some of the obstacles most endemic to legislation, they exacerbate other problems.  We conclude by analyzing emerging hybrid procedures that avoid the largest obstacles associated with purely legislative and purely market-based procedures.",1999,,Michael | Steven,Morris | Su
1548,The Evolution of Norms,"This paper analyzes the emergence of norms from an evolutionary perspective.  It is hypothesized that norms diffuse not necessarily because they are functional for the communities in which they are embedded but because in certain selection environments they are evolutionarily advantaged: norm-like strategies can be evolutionarily stable while all strategies that are not norm-like are unstable.  Further, we show that, contrary to classical functionalist theories, there are norms that are both evolutionarily stable and ""dysfunctional"" (Pareto-deficient).  However, functionalism is partially redeemed by our quantitative finding that in a wide class of situations (games) functional-i.e., Pareto-optimal-norms are more stable than dysfunctional ones.  We then apply and extend these results in order to analyze the relative evolutionary stability of ascripitive norms, which take into account people's ascriptive identities (e.g., caste norms), versus the stability of universalistic norms, which ignore identity and focus only on people's actions.  Although ascriptive norms can be evolutionarily stable, in a wide class of situations universalistic norms turn out to be more stable in several quantitative respects.",1998,fbendor,Piotr,Swistak
1558,Performance-Based Incentives in a Dynamic Principal-Agent Model,"The principal-agent paradigm, in which a principal has a primary stake in the performance of some system but delegates operational control of that system to an agent, has many natural applications in operations management (OM).  However, existing principal-agent models are of limited use to OM researchers because they cannot represent the rich dynamic structure required of OM models.  This paper formulates a novel dynamic model that overcomes these limitations by combining the principal-agent framework with the physical structure of a Markov decision process.  In this model one has system moving from state to state as time passes, with transition probabilities depending on actions chosen by an agent, and a principal who pays the agent based on state transitions observed.  The principal seeks an optimal payment scheme, striving toinduce the actions tht will maximize her finite horizon expected discounted profits.  Although dynamic principal-agent models similar to the one proposed here are considered intractable, a set of assumptions are introduced that enable a systematic analysis.  These assumptions involve the ''economic structure"" of  the model but not is 'physical structure'.  Under these asumptions, the paper establishes that one can use a dynamic programming recursion to derive an optimal payment scheme.  This scheme is memoryless and satifies a generalization of Bellman's principle of optimality.  Important managerial insights are highlighted in the context of a two-state example called ""the maintenance problem''.",1999,stefzen | elp,,
1571,Political Conservatism As Motivated Social Cognition,"Political conservatism is considered as a special case of motivated social cognition. This perspective helps to integrate three classes of thories: (a) conservatism as a simention of personality ( such as authoritarianism, dogmatism, intolerance of ambiguity, and ideogical polarity), (b) conservatism as an attemp to satisfy epistemic and extntial needs (such as needs for cognitive closure, regulatory focus, and terror management), and (c) conservatism as a socio-polictical ideology arising from the cllective rationalization od social systems (such as theories of symbolic politics, social domincance, and system justification). While these classes of theories differ from one another in terms of orgins and assumptions, they all lead to the conclusion that policticalconservatism satisfies the dispostional and suational needs of certain individuals,groups,and systems to explain,order,and justify the status quo and to prvent change and disruption.",1999,,John | Arie | Jack,Jost | Kruglanski | Glaser
1572,Legislative Organization with Informational Committees,"Legislative organization in the face of uncertain policy outcomes has been investigated from the perspective of signaling models in which an informed committee reports a bill and the legislature then amends, enacts or rejects the bill.  As the political principal, however, the legislature could take the lead rather than react to the work of its agent.  This paper presents a new theory of legislative organization with informational committees inwhich the legislature as the principal explicitly structures its arrangement with a committee before the committee begins its legislative work.  The theory provides a number of quite different predictions.  For example, in the signaling theory a closed rule can create stronger incentives for specialization by a moderate committee than an open rule, whereas in this theory an open rule provides stronger incentives.  Moreover, the legislature prefers to structure t he arrangement with the committee withe committee rather than simly react to its efforts",1999,dbaron,,
1573,Dispute Prevention without Courts in Vietnam,"Vietnam's firms contract without the shadow of the law and only partly in the shadow of the future.  Although contracting rests in part on the threat of loss of future business, firms often are willing to renegotiate following a breach, so the retaliation is not as forceful as in the standard repeated-game story and not a effective a sanction.  To ensure agreements are kept, firms rely on other devices to supplement repeated-game incentives.  Firms scrutinize their trading partners.  Community sanctions are occasionally invoked.  Transactions with greater risk of reneging are supported by more elaborate governance structures.",1999,,John | Christopher ,McMillan | Woodruff
1576,The Role of Culture in the Resolution of Information Incongruity: Additivity versus Attenuation,"Past research on dual process models of persuasion has documented that, when faced with  information incongruity, individuals tend to form product evaluations by attenuating the less diagnostic information, relying solely on the more diagnostic information. The current research suggests that this way of resolving incongruity may be culture specific. Consistent with recent  research in cultural psychology, we show that individuals in a North American culture tend to  follow the attenuation strategy described above, while individuals in a Chinese culture tend to follow an additive strategy where both pieces of information are combined to jointly influence evaluations. Two additional experiments provide further support for the proposed psychological mechanism underlying these findings. Results from these experiments suggest that different evaluation strategies such as additivity and attenuation are not culture-specific. ",1999,jaaker,Jaideep,Sengupta
1577,The Pleasures and Pains of Distinct Self-Construals:  The Role of Interdependence in Regulatory Focus,"Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) distinguishes between self-regulatory processes that focus upon promotion (gain-focused) and prevention (loss-focused) strategies for goal pursuit.  Five studies provide support for the hypothesis that these self-regulatory strategies differ for individuals with distinct self-construal patterns that encourage one or another from of goal pursuit.  Specifically, individuals with a dominant independent self-construal were predicted to place more emphasis on promotion focused information, whereas those with a dominant interdependent self-construal were predicted to place more emphasis on prevention focus.  Support for this hypothesis was obtained for participants who scored high versus low on the Independent-Interdependent scale in the U.S., participants from a western (U.S.) versus eastern (Hong Kong) culture, and participants across cultures who were presented with an independent versus interdependent situation (e.g., individual versus team event).  Moreover, the moderating role of interdependence upon regulatory focus could be seen in both importance ratings of promotion vs. prevention framed information, and affective responses consistent with promotion or prevention focus.  These results, robut across distinct operationalizations of self-construal, are discussed in light of cultural differences in socialization, self-enhancement motives, and optimism and pessimism.  Finally, the findings also underscore the malleability of self-construal within the individual, and may thus help predict when distinct self-regulatory strategies will be invoked.",2000,jaaker,Angela | Wendi,Lee | Gardner
1579,Accessibility or Diagnosticity? Disentangling the Influence of Culture on Persuasion Processes and Attitudes,"This research explores the extent to which differences in perceived diagnosticity as compared with differences in the accessibility of associations embedded in persuasion appeals better account for the attitudinal differences found in the culture and persuasion literature. Experiment 1 replicates basic findings showing that high culture-distinct associations lead to more favorable attitudes for individuals in the target culture relative to a nontarget culture, while low culture-distinct associations lead to more attitudinal similarities across cultural boundaries. Experiments 2 and 3 explore two potential explanations for these effects. Convergent evidence, provided through within-culture and across-culture mediation analysis, is more supportive of the differential accessibility explanation. That is, high culture-distinct associations may be valued in the nontarget culture but are relatively inaccessible in memory at an individual level. The results of these experiments help to reconcile conflicting findings in the consumer psychology literature, shed insight on why cultural differences might occur, and add to the growing body of research that identifies conditions under which cultural similarities in persuasion processes and effects may be found.

1580,Off-Target?  An Explanation for Asymetric Effects of Attitude Structure,"CONTACT AUTHOR JENNIFER AAKER DIRECTLY FOR PAPER COPIES._x000B__x000B__x000B__x000B_Researchers argue that the effectiveness of cognitive versus affective persuasive appeals depends in part on whether the appeal targets a primarily cognitive or affective attitude base.   However, considerable reserach shows that the effects of intra-attitudinal structure hold only for affectively-based attitudes and not cognitively-based attitudes.  We examine two potential explanations for this asymmetry in intra-attitudinal structure effects:  Scale Response Incompatibility and Component Form Difference.  Results of Experiment I do not support a Scale Response Incompatibility explanation, which suggests that intra-attitudinal structure effects exist for cognitively-based attitudes but need to be measured with cognition-based scales.  Results of Experiment 2 provide support for a Component Form Difference explanation, which suggests that affectively-based and cognitively-based attitudes are congentially different in structure and form.  Therefore, symmetry intra-attitudinal structure effects occurs only when these differences are taken into account.",1999,jaaker,Aimee,Drolet
1586,Culture Dependent Assimilation and Differentiation of the Self:  Preferences for Consumption Symbols in the United States and China,"In two studies, we investigate how differences in self-construal patterns affect preferences for consumption symbols through the process of self expression.  The results of Study 1 demonstrate that individuals with a dominant independent self-construal hold attitudes which allow them to express that they are distinct from others.  In contrast, individuals with a dominant interdependent self-construal are more likely to hold attitudes that demonstrate points of similarity with their peers.  By unpackaging these culture-based effects at an individual level through a set of mediation analyses, we show that when meaning is controlled for, the attitudinal differences across cultural groups dissipate.  Study 2 provides additional evidence for the mechanism presumed to underlie the results by identifying differential schematic processes as the driver of expressed preferences.  We find that differential levels of recall for similar and distinct items exist across culturally-encouraged selves, documenting higher recall for schema-inconsistent information.  We discuss the results in terms of differences and similaries in psychological processes across cultures and encourage future research that expands the framework to group decisions and social preferences.",2001,jaaker,,
1587,Organizational Roles and Transitions to Entrepreneurship,"This paper asks how we can predict entrepreneurship, an individual's participation in the founding of a new organization.  We advance a model that combines aspects of two distinct perspectives on entrepreneurship:  the social structural view that sees context as the driving force in new venture formation, and the perspective that each founding is an idiosyncratic event attributable to the charisma of the entrepreneur.  We propose that the organizational context of an individual either accelerates or retards the likelihood of entrepreneurship - depending on the individual's role in the organization.  The effects of role hinge, we argue, on the founder's charismatic identity, and the decoupling of this identity from the organization as it ages and grows.  We test our model on a dataset created from responses to a career history survey administered to all alumni of a major U.S. business school.  Our findings support the proposition that organizational properties that affect the likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur do so in opposite ways for organizational members and founders.  Members of organizations become increasingly unlikely to engage in entrepreneurship as their organization ages and grows.  By contrast, as an organization develops, its founder is increasingly likely to leave and start a new venture.  We discuss how our theory and results demonstrate the value of a socilogical perspective on entrepreneurship.",1999,fbarnett,Stanislave,Dobrev
1589,"Supply Chain Contracting:  Non-Recurring Engineering Charge, Minimum Order Quantity, and Boilerplate Contracts","This paper develops a contracting model in which a supplier and a buyer have an opportunity to enter a long-term supply relationship.  The buyer knows whether the market for his new product is either large or small, but the supplier can only make an assessment of the probabilities.  We derive and characterize the optimal contractual forms from the supplier's perspective.  The optimal offering of the supplier (to the buyer) is one of the following three forms:  (1) a customized menu (which depends on the supplier's probability assessment) that will always lead to a signed contract (by the buyer regardless of his market size), (2) a boilerplate contract (which is independent of the assessment) that will be signed only if the buyer's market is large, or (3) a boilerplate menu that will always lead to a signed contract.  The optimal contractual form helps explain the practice of setup (or non-recurring engineering) charge, minimum order quantity (with a buyback option), and boilerplate contracts.  The menus enable the buyer to signal his market size to the supplier in a credible way and induce the supplier to build the corresponding capacity.",1999,eporteus | fwhang,,
1594,Accruals and the Prediction of Future Cash Flows,"Building on the Dechow, Kothari, and Watts (1998) model of the accrual process, this study provides insights into the role of accruals in predicting future cash flows.  The model shows that each accrual component reflects different information relating to future cash flows; aggregate earnings masks this information.  As predicted, disaggregating accruals into major components - change in accounts receivable, change in accounts payable, change in inventory, depreciation, amortization, and other accruals - significantly enhances predictive ability.  Each accrual component, including depreciation and amortization, is significant with the predicted sign in predicting future cash flows incremental to current cash flow.  The cash flow and accrual components of current earnings have substantially more predictive ability for future cash flows than several lags of aggregate earnings.  The inferences are robust to several alternative specifications, including controlling for operating cash cycle and industry membership.",2000,fbarth,Karen | Donald,Nelson | Cram

In this family of policies system status is reviewed at discrete points in time, and at each such point the controller formulates a processing plan for the next review period, based on the queue length vector observed, which is them executed in open-loop fashion.

1598,Middle-Status Conformity: Theoretical Restatement and Empirical Demonstration in Two Markets,"A longstanding sociological conjecture predicts that conformity is high in the middle and low at either end of a status order.  Despite the intuitive pull of this idea, it has encountered both theoretical and empirical difficulties.  This paper aims to reestablish the conjecture in two ways.  First, we clarify the theoretical basis for expecting such an inverted U-shaped curve, taking care to specify key scope conditions on the social psychological orientations of the actors, the characteristics of the status structure, and the nature of the relevant actions.  Second, we validate the conjecture in two markets that both meet such conditions and allow for the elimination of confounding effects: the Silicon Valley legal services market and the market for investment advice.  We show that middle-status market participants (law firms or securities analysts) are least likely to undertake an action (the announcement of a family law practice or the publication of a `sell' rating) that threatens their acceptance in a desirable market segment.  These results inform our understanding of how an actor's status interacts with her role incumbency to produce differential conformity in markets and other settings that meet the specified scope conditions.",2001,,Ezra,Zuckerman
1604,"I Seek Pleasures, We Avoid Pains: The Role of Self Regulatory Goals in Information Processing and Persuasion","In four experiments, we show that goals associated with approach and avoidance needs influence persuasion and that the accessibility of distinct self-views moderates these effects. Specifically, individuals with an accessible independent self-view are more persuaded by promotion-focused information that is consistent with an approach goal. In contrast, individuals whose interdependent self-view is more accessible are more persuaded by prevention focused information that is consistent with an avoidance goal. When the persuasive appeal is compatible with self-regulatory focus, individuals demonstrate greater recall of the message content and are more discerning regarding argument strength. These findings provide convergent evidence that central processing under goal compatible conditions underlies the persuasion effects.  ",2001,jaaker,Angela,Lee

1625,Incentive Efficient Control of a Make-to-Stock Production System,"This paper considers a principal-agent variant of the classical make-to-stock single server queueing system.  A principal (whom we call ""her"") has a primary stake in the performance of the system, incurs linear holding and backorder inventory costs, and delegates production control to an agent.  Production is modeled by a single server queue with exponential service times, flexible production rates, and convex production cost.  The production rates are chosen by the agent and are unobservable by the principal. The principal pays the agent according to observed inventory levels and job completions, and strives to induce action that would minimize her expected total discounted cost.  Using the dynamic principal-agent framework of Plambeck and Zenios (2000), we show that the principal's optimal incentive payment scheme consists of a differential piece rate and a delay penalty.  Furthermore, this scheme fails to induce the first-best production rates that are optimal in centralized system.  The main frictional forces contributing to this ""loss of efficiency"" are also identified: In addition to discounting and risk aversion in the agent's preferences, which are standard causes of friction in dynamic agency models, an increasing marginal cost of production and slack in the agent's capacity are also found to be lead contributors, Heavy traffic analysis supports these findings through closed form expressions for the performance of the system under the optimal incentive scheme.

1630,Off-Target? Changing Cognitive-Based Attitudes,"Researchers argue that the effectiveness of cognitive versus affective persuasive appeals depends in part on whether the appeal is congruent or incongruent with a primarily cognitive or affective attitude base. However, considerable research suggests that these persuasion effects may hold only for predominantly affective attitudes and not cognitive attitudes. Indeed, results of Experiment 1 show that the relative effectiveness of congruent relative to incongruent persuasion appeals holds for brands with predominantly affective associations, but not those with predominantly cognitive associations. Experiment 2 explores one reason for this anomalous finding: Cognitive attitudes may be relatively impervious to persuasive appeals because the probability of targeting the specific attribute on which the cognitive attitude is based is smaller. The results are supportive, showing that significant persuasion effects are found when the specific beliefs on which cognitive attitudes are based are taken into account. However, these effects only occur under conditions of low cognitive load and not high cognitive load where resources for the cognitive processing of the appeals are limited. We discuss the implications of the research for the role of attitude structure in understanding persuasion effects and the interplay of affective and cognitive elements in persuasion processes",2002,jaaker,,

Experiment 1 demonstrates that this effect appears to be due to increased levels of felt discomfort that arise for those with a lower, but not higher, propensity to accept duality when exposed to mixed emotional appeals Experiments 2 and 3 replicate this result across product categories and distinct operationalizations of duality acceptance, and show that results are not due to differences in the recognition of depicted emotions. Theoretical implications regarding boundary conditions of emotional dissonance and distinctions between emotional and cognitive dissonance are discussed. ",2002,jaaker,Patti,Williams

Our findings also indicate that earnings management is not concentrated in these firms, but is pervasive across the entire earnings distribution.  Consistent with income smoothing, the firms in the left tail of the earnings distribution understate reserve accruals while those in the right tail overstate reserve accruals.  The results are similar for both stock and mutual insurers.  We also show that both financially healthy and distressed firms manage earnings to avoid losses, and that both types of firms contribute to an overall appearance of income smoothing and opportunistic regulatory reporting.

Diffusion models have attracted considerable attention in the marketing literature as a way of understanding the market evolution of new products.  While these models have proved extremely flexible in explaining dynamics after sales have peaked, there are few management applications prior to launch.  Those examples that do exist rely primarily on management judgment and analogy to similar past products rather than consumer feedback for calibration.  One specific type of diffusion model developed to address the pre-launch calibration problem, individual level diffusion models, has shown promise in the laboratory and at the aggregate level post launch, but has yet to be implemented in a practical managerial application.  We discuss the modeling, estimation and measurement issues in using an individual level diffusion model in practice and demonstrate the performance of one for the pre-launch sales forecasting of a new software product.  The model enables us to estimate how many consumers will buy, when they will buy, who will buy, and why they will buy.  We validate forecasts for the model and compare them to those using traditional methods of estimating aggregate model parameters.  ",2000,jlattin,,
1664,Dynamic Customization of Marketing Messages in Interactive Media,"As a consequence of significant advances in information technology, the marketing community has become increasingly interested in the possibilities afforded by interactive media. The explosion of the World Wide Web is the most notable example of such interest. Interactive media allow the marketer to 1) identify the consumer and characteristics of the consumer, 2) decide on the marketing message real-time, and 3) capture response to marketing communications. In contrast to some traditional media (e.g., television, radio, print), which send one standardized message to all consumers, interactive media allow the marketer to deliver customized messages tailored to the individual consumer. In addition, unlike most other marketing environments which require media planning decisions to be made in advance, interactive media allow the marketer to make decisions ""on the fly,"" using information about previous decisions to guide the current decision. In other words, marketing decisions through interactive media can be truly dynamic.  In this paper, we formulate a unique procedure to exploit the benefits of interactive media. We study the general problem of a marketer whose objective is to maximize expected return (e.g., response rate) over the course of a direct response marketing campaign. The marketer has the ability to dynamically allocate two or more unique marketing messages (e.g., ads, Web pages) to achieve this objective. Consumer response to a particular message may depend on a set of covariates (e.g., demographic characteristics). In ignorance of the true relationship between response and the covariates, the marketer can use regression techniques to learn about the parameters of the response functions. Moreover, because the marketer can continually update the parameter estimates, he can also continually adapt the decision of which message to select.  The theoretical framework we draw from is the multi-armed bandit problem in statistical decision theory in which there is a fundamental dilemma between ""information,"" such as the need to learn about the parameter values governing response for each ad, and ""control,"" such as the objective of maximizing response rate. In such problems, it may be wise to sacrifice some potential early payoff for the prospect of gaining information about consumers that will allow for more informed decisions later. An important difference in our problem is that we incorporate covariates (although our solution can handle the standard non-covariate case).  Suppose that the marketer has two or more unique marketing messages available and weak prior beliefs as to the effectiveness of each message. The marketer can randomly assign the messages for a brief initialization period to collect training samples for each of the messages. From then on, the marketer can estimate response functions, which can be periodically updated. In deciding which message to select for any particular consumer, the marketer can compare the regression estimates and select the message with the highest predicted response. We refer to this approach as the myopic rule. However, since the predictions are estimated with imprecision, it may be worthwhile for the marketer to calculate ""uncertainty adjustments,"" and incorporate these adjustments in its message selection decisions. The uncertainty adjustments reflect the imprecision in the parameter estimates of the regression models. The adjustments are larger for consumers that have extreme characteristics (covariates) than for typical consumers because an extreme consumer will provide more information about the nature of the response function than a typical consumer will.  Our proposed procedure is easy to implement, and will enable marketers to increase the success of their marketing campaigns. In addition, the approach can be used in several different marketing applications, including direct response advertising, Web page design, and product development.  ",2000,jlattin,Christopher ,Gooley

1688,Earning The Right To Indulge: Effort As A Determinant Of Customer Preferences Towards Frequency Program Rewards,"Although frequency programs (FPs) have become ubiquitous in the marketplace and a key marketing mix tool for promoting customer relationship and loyalty, we still know very little about the factors that determine how such programs are evaluated by consumers.  The present research investigates the impact of the level of effort that participants must invest to obtain the reward (e.g., the required number of miles, points, store purchases) on the types of rewards they prefer and, consequently, on the decision to join the FP.  In particular, we propose that higher required effort shifts consumer preferences from necessity (e.g., gasoline or supermarket vouchers) to luxury rewards (e.g., massage, cruise), because higher efforts reduce the guilt often associated with choosing luxuries over necessities.  This proposition was supported in a series of studies with approximately 3,100 consumers, which demonstrated that (a) higher program requirements (e.g., 50 vs. 10 required purchases) shift preferences in favor of luxury rewards, (b) this effect is also observed when consumers choose between luxury and necessity rewards (of the same value) that they themselves proposed, and (c) the effect of effort on reward preferences is stronger among consumers who tend to feel guilty about luxury consumption and among those for whom the effort is invested in the context of work rather than pleasure.  In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher effort signals higher value of luxury rewards, we show that (a) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer’s effort is higher, the shift in preference towards luxuries is still observed, and (b) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the FP decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards.  We discuss the theoretical implications of this research as well as the practical implications with respect to the design, targeting, and promotion of FPs. ",2001,itamars,Ran,Kivetz
1695,Inflation and Price Setting in a Natural Experiment,"We analyse the behaviour of price setters in Poland during transition from a planned to a market economy, using a large disaggregated data set. The size of price changes and the frequency of adjustment both fall as the inflation rate declines.  Price variability increases with inflation. The effect of expected inflation is much stronger than the effect of unexpected inflation. Price setters are forward looking and follow a mixture of state- and time-contingent policies. These results are broadly consistent with the menu cost model. The bottom line is this: it takes sellers of sausage, eggs, toothpaste, vacuum cleaners, car-wash operators etc. just a few years to figure out how to adjust prices in a market environment.",2001,skrz,Jerzy,Konieczny

1723,Three Tools for Forecasting Federal Elections: Lessons from 2001,"How best to predict Australian federal election results?  This article analyses three forecasting tools – opinion polls, economic models, and betting odds.  Historically, we find that opinion polls taken close to the election are quite accurate, while economic models provide better medium-run forecasts.  The 2001 election largely follows this pattern, although the economic models provided more accurate projections than recorded through the 1990s.  Against these, we compare betting odds, analyzing a rich data source from one of Australia’s largest bookmakers, Centrebet.  The betting market not only correctly forecast the election outcome, but also provided very precise estimates of outcomes in a host of individual electorates.  Betting fluctuations provide an intriguing quantitative record of the shifting fortunes of the campaign.  We conclude that – particularly in marginal seats – the press may have better served its readers by reporting betting odds than by conducting polls.",2001,,Andrew | Justin,Leigh | Wolfers
1725,Rational Ambivalence: Asymmetric Effects of Work Group Demography On Men and Women's Responses to Being in the Minority,"Most organizational demography research has been theoretically grounded in either the similarity-attraction paradigm or social categorization theory (Williams & O'Reilly, 1998). While useful, some of this research has uncovered inconsistent or contradictory findings. We suggest that these inconsistent results may arise from assumptions that members of different demographic categories will react symmetrically to variations in work group demography. But, because of historical differences in their status and the experience of being in the numerical majority or minority at work, men and women, for example, are likely to react differently to being members of differently composed groups. Using data from a field study of a large clothing manufacturer and retailer we found that men and women most wanted to remain in groups that were dominated by males. Men and women were also more normatively committed to groups dominated by their own sex, but were both more instrumentally committed to male-dominated groups. Thus, women may face a form of rational ambivalence; they are most comfortable in groups in which their sex dominates numerically, but are likely to trade off the comfort of working with similar others for the prospect of greater career advancement associated with being a member of a male-dominated, historically higher status, group.",2002,coreilly,Jennifer,Chatman
1740,The Impact of Duplicate Orders on Demand Estimation and Capacity Investment,"Motivated by a $2.2 billion inventory write-off by Cisco Systems, we investigate how duplicate orders can lead a manufacturer to err in estimating the demand rate and customers' sensitivity to delay, and to make faulty decisions about capacity investment.  We consider a manufacturer that sells through two distributors.  If a customer finds that his distributor is out-of-stock, then he will sometimes seek to make a purchase from the other distributor; if the latter is also out-of-stock, the customer will order from both distributors.  When his order is filled by one of the distributors, the customer cancels any duplicate orders.  Furthermore, the customer cancels all of his outstanding orders after a random period of time.    Assuming that the manufacturer is unaware of duplicate orders, we prove that she will overestimate both the demand rate and the cancellation rate.  Suprisingly, failure to account for duplicate orders can cause short-term underinvestment in capacity.  However, in long term equilibrium under stable demand conditions the manufacturer overinvests in capacity.  Our results suggest that Cisco's write-off was caused by estimation errors and cannot be blamed entirely on the economic downturn.  Finally, we provide some guidance on estimation in the presence of double orders.",2003,elp,Mor,Armony
1741,Optimal Incentive Compatible Control of a Queue with Some Patient Customers,"Consider an exponential single-server queue with two classes of customers that differ in price-and delay-sensitivity.  A system manager sets the production rate and a static price for each class, dynamically quotes the leadtime for each class of customer and decides the order in which customers are processed.  The arrival rate for each class decreases linearly with price and leadtime.  The manager's objective is to maximize profit, subject to the constraint that each customer must be processed within the promised leadtime.  Because the manager cannot distinguish whether a potential customer is of class 1 or class 2, the prices and quoted leadtimes must be incentive compatible.  That is, each customer chooses the price and leadtime combination intended for his class. Assuming that some customers will tolerate a long queueing delay in return for a small price discount, we show that this problem has a simple near-optimal solution.  Under our proposal policy, capacity utilization is near 100%.  Impatient customers pay a premium for immediate delivery and receive priority in scheduling.  When the queue is long, patient customers are quoted a leadtime proportional to the current queue length.  However, when the queue is short, the quoted leadtime is longer than the actual queueing delay.  This ensures that the impatient class 1 customers will not choose the deal intended for class 2 customers.

1743,Optimal Leadtime Differentiation via Diffusion Approximations,"This study illustrates how a manufacturer can use leadtime differentiation- selling the same product to different customers at different prices based on delivery leadtime- to simultaneously increase revenue and reduce capacity requirements.  The manufacturer's production facility is modeled by exponential single-server queue with two classes of customers that differ in price- and delay-sensitivity.  The manufacturer chooses the service rate and a static price for each class of customer, and then dynamically quotes leadtimes to potential customers and decides the order in which customers are processed.  The arrival rate for each class decreases linearly with price and leadtime.  The manufacturer's objective is to maximize profit, subject to the constraint that each customer must be processed within the promised leadtime.  Assuming that some customers will tolerate a long delivery leadtime, we show that this problem has a simple near-optimal solution.  Under our proposed policy, capacity utilization is near 100%.  Impatient customers pay a premium for immediate delivery and receive priority in scheduling, whereas patient customers are quoted a leadtime proportional to the current queue length.  Queue length and leadtime can be closely approximated by a reflected Ornstein Uhlenbeck diffusion process.  Hence, we have a closed form expression for profit, and choose prices and capacity to optimize this.  In case customers may choose either the class 1 deal or the class 2 deal, the proposed policy is made incentive compatible by quoting a leadtime for the class 2 (patient) customers that is longer than the actual queueing delay.

1750,"Sell the Plant? The Impact of Contract Manufacturing on Innovation, Capacity and Profitability","In the electronics industry and others, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are selling their production facilities to contract manufacturers (CMs).  The CMs achieve high capacity utilization through pooling (supplying many different OEMs).  Meanwhile, the OEMs focus on innovation: research and development, product design, and marketing.  We examine how this new industry structure affects investment in innovation and capacity, and thus profitability.  In particular, innovation is noncontractible, so OEMs will invest less in innovation than is ideal for the industry as a whole.  Hence, although contract manufacturing can increase profit through more efficient capacity utilization, it may instead reduce profit by weakening the incentives for innovation.  We find that contract manufacturing improves profitability for the industry as a whole if and only if OEMs are in a strong bargaining position vis-a-vis the CM.  Alternatively, OEMs may retain their production facilities and pool capacity with other OEMs through supply contracts or a joint venture.  This may result in overinvestment in innovation and capacity.  Nevertheless, weak OEMs would do better to outsource among themselves rather than to a CM.",2002,elp,Terry,Taylor
1764,Renegotiation of Supply Contracts,"After entering into supply contracts, frims often later renegotiate the terms of those contracts.  For example, firms that obtain market demand information after signing supply contracts may benefit by renegotiating the contracts to allow buyers facing poor market conditions to purchase less than their contractual commitment and allowing buyers favorable conditions to purchase more.  Consider a setting in which two buyers invest in innovation (product development, marketing) and obtain supply from a single manufacturer through quantity flexibility contracts, which specify the minimum quantity the manufacturer must supply and the minimum quantity the buyer must purchase.  The potential for renegotiation of the supply contracts has important implications for the way firms make investments in innovation and capacity, the way capacity is allocated, and the resulting profits of firms.  We provide clear conditions under which the potential for renegotiation stimulates or retards innovation.  Renegotiation can greatly increase system profit, provided that contracts are designed to anticipate renegotiation.  Anticipating the possibility of renegotiation significantly impacts how contracts should be designed.  Failing to anticipate renegotiation typically leads to contracts that contain far too much flexibility.  Such contracts perform poorly relative to contracts designed to anticipate renegotiation.  Finally, employing tradeable options can lead to even greater system profit than optimal quantity flexibility contracts that anticipate renegotiation.",2002,elp,Terry,Taylor

In contrast, there is no significant increase in market value for a control group of countries that do not sign agreements. The results persist after controlling for IMF agreements, trade liberalizations, capital account liberalizations, and privatization programs.  The stock market revaluations forecast higher future net resource transfers and GDP growth.  While markets respond favorably to debt relief in the Brady countries, there is no evidence to suggest that current debt relief efforts for the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) will achieve similar results.",2002,,Peter | Serkan,Henry | Arslanalp
1774,"Trade, Growth and the Size of Countries*","Normally, economists take the size of countries as an exogenous variable which does need to be explained.  Nevertheless, the borders of countries and therefore their size change, partially in response to economic factors such as the pattern of international trade.  Conversely, the size of countries influences their economic performance and their preferences for international economic policies – for instance smaller countries have a greater stake in maintaining free trade.  In this paper we review the theory and the evidence concerning a growing body of research that has considered both the impact of market size on growth and the endogenous determination of country size.  We show that our understanding of economic performance and of the history of international economic integration can be greatly improved by bringing the issue of country size at the forefront of the analysis of growth.",2002,wacziarg,Alberto | Enrico,Alesina | Spolaore
1776,Valuing Internal vs. External Knowledge: Explaining the Preference for Outsiders,"This paper compares how  much managers value knowledge from internal and external sources.  Although many theories account for favoritism toward insiders, we find that preferences for knowledge obtained from outsiders are also prevalent.  Two complementary case studies and survey data from managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge more highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through which this process occurs.  We found evidence that the preference for outsider knowledge is the result of managerial responses to 1) the contrasting status implications of learning from internal versus external competitors, and 2) the availability or scarcity of knowledge—internal knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater scrutiny, while external knowledge is moreharder to obtain and this scarce, whichity makes it appear more special and unique.  We conclude by considering some consequences of external knowledge preference for organizational functioning.",2003,pfeff,Tanya,Menon
1777,Optimal Control Assemble-to-Order Systems with Delay Guarantees,"Consider a high-volume assemble-to-order system with multiple products and components in which  component production can be expedited at some additional cost. The objective is to maximize expected discounted profit subject to assembling orders within a guaranteed maximum leadtime. We show that  optimal product pricing and component production balances customer demand with component supply, meaning the system is in ""heavy traffic"". In this regime, the system exhibits a reduction in problem  dimensionality. In particular, the limiting diffusion approximation has dimension equal to the number of  components (rather than the number of components PLUS the number of products). We use this insight to derive an easily implementable dynamic control policy for sequencing product orders for assembly and expediting components that is optimal in heavy traffic. We finish by recommending a non-basestock inventory policy which accounts for dependencies amongst components and is based on the solution to a singular diffusion control problem.",2003,elp,Amy,Ward
1780,The Formation and Malleability of Brand Personality Inferences,"Considerable research in consumer experimental psychology has examined the self-expressive role of brands, but has found little support for the premise that the interaction of the personality traits associated with a brand and those associated with an individual’s self-concept influence attitudes.  The current research focuses on the influence of the malleable self-concept on consumer attitudes toward a brand based on its personality associations.  The results of two experiments demonstrate that traits that are made accessible by salient situational cues and those that are chronically accessible (schematic traits) positively influence consumer attitudes toward a brand based on its personality associations.  More importantly, these effects were tested in a set of theory-based interactions relying on the self-monitoring individual difference variable.  Self congruity was enhanced for low versus high self-monitoring individuals, and situation congruity was enhanced for high versus low self-monitoring individuals.  Together, these experiments shed light on the self-expressive use of brands and the role of brand personality in influencing consumer attitudes.",1999,jaaker,,
1793,Subjective Reasoning in Dynamic Games,"A unified framework is developed for representation of, and reasoning about dynamic games.  A game is described by the subjective knowledge of players at hypothetical situations - the epistemic game form.  Subjective knowledge - termed confidence - allows us to replace objective reasoning about hypothetical events with reasoning about the confidence of hypothetical identities, i.e., the subjective reasoning of players in hypothetical situations.  This leads to an endogenous definition for players' action sets.  Applying subjective reasoning to the ""Bear-Quiche"" signaling game, the ""Burning Money"" game and others, provides a characterization of the dynamic reasoning by players that leads to the suggested solutions for these games.  For perfect information games, rationality and common confidence of future rationality imply backward induction, although common confidence of rationality can logically contradict the definition of the game.

Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external funds as unduly costly.  Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing.  We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel data on personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs.  We classify CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk.  We find that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow, particularly in equity-dependent firms.",2004,,Geoffrey | Ulrike,Tate | Malmendier
1811,A Separation Principle for Assemble-to-Order Systems With Expediting,"In an assemble-to-order system, a wide variety of products are rapidly assembled from component inventories, in response to customer orders.  Orders must be filled within a product-specific target leadtime.  In the event that some of the components required to fill an order are out-of-stock, these components are expedited at a high cost per unit.  The objective is to minimize the expected infinite horizon discounted cost of nominal component production and expediting.  This discounted formulation captures financial inventory holding costs.  The levers for control are (1) sequencing orders for assembly (2) component production (3) component expediting.  Under the assumption that expedited components have zero leadtime, the multi-dimensional assemble-to-order control problem separates into single-item inventory control problems.  The optimal production and expediting policy for each component is independent of all other components.  Hence the literature on single-item inventory management with expediting or lost sales is directly relevant to the control of assemble-to-order systems.",2003,elp,Amy,Ward
1813,Supply Chain Relationships and Contracts: The Impact of Repeated Interaction on Capacity Investment and Procurement,"Consider a firm that is developing a highly innovative product.  Producing the product requires that an upstream supplier invest in production capacity well in advance.  Because the product is ill-defined at the time when the supplier initiates his capacity investment, the firms are unable to write court-enforceable contracts that specify the terms of trade.  The supplier faces a classic hold up problem.  When the firms finally do negotiate the terms of trade, his cost of capacity will be sunk (irrelevant).  Anticipating this, the supplier will underinvest in capacity.  However, with repeated new product introduction and capacity investment, the firms may adopt informal terms of trade:  The buyer promises to purchase at a price that reflects the cost of capacity, and the supplier increases his capacity investment.  The value of future cooperation creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised.  Assuming symmetric information about demand, capacity and production costs, we derive optimal informal terms of trade that are appealingly simple.  Then, assuming that the buyer cannot observe the supplier's capacity investment and the supplier cannot observe the buyer's demand, we compare the performance of informal price-only and quantity commitment agreements.  If the production cost is low and either the capacity cost is low or the discount factor is high, then the buyer should promise to purchase a specific quantity rather than simply promise to pay a per unit price; otherwise, the buyer should simply promise to pay a specified unit price.

1815,Bringing the Frame into Focus:  The Influence of Regulatory Fit on Processing Fluency and Persuasion,"This research demonstrates that people’s goals associated with regulatory focus moderate the effect of message framing on persuasion. The results of six experiments show that appeals presented in gain frames are more persuasive when the message is promotion focused, whereas loss framed appeals are more persuasive when the message is prevention focused. These regulatory focus effects suggesting heightened vigilance against negative outcomes and heightened eagerness toward positive outcomes are replicated when perceived risk is manipulated. Enhanced processing fluency leading to more favorable evaluations in conditions of compatibility appears to underlie these effects. The findings underscore the regulatory fit principle that accounts for the persuasiveness of message framing effects, and highlight how processing fluency may contribute to the “feeling right” experience when strategy of goal pursuit matches one's goal.",2004,jaaker,Angela,Lee
1823,The Effect of Explicit Reference Points on Consumer Choice and Online Bidding Behavior,"Providing explicit instructions to compare one option to other (reference) options is one of the most basic and commonly used promotional and persuasion tactics. Building on prior research on persuasion knowledge and the impact of suspicion, we propose that the mere fact that consumers are explicitly encouraged to make particular comparisons induces more cautious and careful purchase and bidding behavior. This proposition was supported in a field experiment using online auctions, in which comparisons among listings were either done spontaneously by bidders or were encouraged using an explicit instruction to compare the focal with adjacent listings. A follow-up laboratory experiment provided evidence that a seller who explicitly suggests reference points is perceived as less trustworthy. A third study extended these findings to consumer choice, showing that explicit instructions to compare increase the tendency to make cautious choices (e.g., choose compromise, low risk, and average options). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.",2003,itamars,Utpal,Dholakia
1848,Accounting for Stock Options,"Employee stock options differ substantially from traded options. Most expire within 90 days of the termination of employment, and are forfeited if the employee leaves before vesting. The major accounting standards boards are in agreement that options should be expensed, but companies have legitimate complaints about the proposed methods. For example, the proposals create accounting incentives for firms to lay off employees who hold unvested and nearly worthless options. We propose a simple accounting system, treating options as 90 day options that are extended quarterly, that addresses these legitimate objections. The costs of both new options and the extension of old options are expensed at fair value on the day recognized. As a consequence, all expense recognition produce the same risk-adjusted present value of expected costs. This enables us to allow firms some flexibility in choosing a recognition schedule that mirrors their own labor practices. The system produces objective, transparent, and decision-relevant information.",2005,jbulow,John,Shoven
1872,Bidding with Securities: Auctions and Security Design,"We study security-bid auctions in which bidders compete for an asset by bidding with securities. That is, they offer payments that are contingent on the realized  value of the asset being sold. Such auctions are commonly used, both formally and informally. In formal auctions, the seller generally restricts bids to an ordered set, such as an equity share or royalty rate. By restricting the bids, standard auction formats such as first and second-price auctions can be used. In informal settings with competing buyers, the seller does not commit to a mechanism upfront. Rather, bidders offer  securities and the seller chooses the most attractive bid, based on his beliefs, ex-post.  We characterize equilibrium payoffs and bidding strategies in both formal and informal  auctions. For formal auctions, we examine the impact of both the security design and the  auction format. We define a notion of the steepness of a set of securities, and show that  steeper securities lead to higher revenues. We also show that the revenue equivalence  principle (that expected revenues are independent of the auction format) holds if the set  of permissible securities is ordered and convex (such as equity). Otherwise, it need not  hold. For example, when bidders offer standard debt securities, a second-price auction is  superior. On the other hand, if bidders compete on the conversion ratio of convertible debt, a first-price auction yields higher revenues. We then show that an informal auction yields the lowest possible revenues across all possible formal mechanisms. Finally, we extend our analysis to consider the effects of liquidity constraints, different information assumptions, and some aspects of moral hazard.",2004,skrz | pdemarzo,,
1874,Management Accounting Systems Adoption Decisions: Evidence and Performance Implications from Startup Companies,"Adopting management accounting systems are important events in the life of young and growing companies.  Using a sample of 78 startup companies, we document cross-sectional differences in the adoption of operating budgets as well as seven other management accounting systems. We find that our proxies for agency costs, perceived benefits and costs, complexity of the firm, and culture explain cross-sectional differences in time-to-adoption of budgets. In particular, the presence of venture capital, CEO experience, firm size, and the culture of the organization are associated with this adoption decision.  We further investigate the effect of hiring a financial manager as an endogenous variable.  In the first stage of a two-stage model, we find that CEO total experience, the presence of venture capital funds, culture, and firm size are associated with cross-sectional variation in this hiring decision. When treating this decision as endogenous, time to hiring a financial manager is unrelated to operating budget adoption.  The paper also examines the association between the time-to-adoption of operating budgets and company performance.  We find a significant increase in the size of the company around the adoption of operating budgets; moreover faster adoption of operating budgets is associated with faster growing companies.  We extend the findings to additional management accounting systems including: cash budgets, variance analysis, operating expense approval policies, capital expenditure approval policies, product profitability, customer profitability, and customer acquisition costs.  The influence of industry choice (biotechnology, information technology, or non-tech) is examined in each stage of the research.",2004,gfoster,Antonio,Davila

For a range of common production, financing and investment decisions we consider  alternative asset valuation rules. The criterion for distinguishing among these rules is that the corresponding performance measure should provide managers with robust incentives to make present value maximizing decisions. Such goal congruence is shown to require intertemporal matching of revenues and expenses, though the specific form of matching needed for control purposes generally differs from GAAP. The practitioner oriented literature on economic profit plans has made various, and at times conflicting, recommendations regarding adjustments  to the accounting rules used for external financial reporting. Our goal congruence approach  provides a framework for comparing and evaluating these recommendations.",2005,sterei,Sunil,Dutta

Effects of Personal Knowledge on the Correction of Culture-based Judgments,"Four experiments demonstrate that culture-based differences in persuasion arise when information is processed in a cursory, spontaneous manner, but dissipate when one’s intuitions are supplemented by more deliberative processing.  North Americans are more persuaded by promotion-focused information, and Chinese individuals are more persuaded by prevention-focused information – but only when initial, automatic reactions to messages are given.  Corrections to these default judgments occur when processing is thoughtful.  These results underscore the idea that culture does not exert a constant, unwavering effect on consumer judgments.  One key factor in determining whether culture-based effects loom large or disappear is the degree to which cultural versus more personal knowledge is drawn upon when forming judgments.

1915,"Differentiation, Variation and Selection: Evolutionary Implications of Technical Change Among the Worldwide Population of Hard Disk Drive Makers, 1965-1998","This paper describes a dynamic analysis of technological advances among hard disk drive  (HDD) manufacturers in the areal density of their products across the history of the  industry. The study provides (additional) evidence supporting a view of technological  racing with leap-frogging rather than with persistent leadership domination in the HDD  context—like others, we find that technology leaders in one year are less likely to  innovate in the next year than those firms right behind them in technology. We also  uncover new evidence that technological laggards do not disappear as quickly as  expected by technology racing metaphors where a winner-take-all outcome is expected.  Our efforts to explain this pattern of persistent heterogeneity with the usual kind of  strategic positioning stories and specifications were not notably successful. But we did  find evidence that technological innovation in HDD follows a trajectory consistent with a  proportionate random process (akin to a Gibrat process) that favors technology leaders  but only stochastically. We demonstrate through simulation that evolution in a population  with selection favoring a characteristic evolving as a proportionate random process  generates increased variation. This contrasts with a common social science framework  for viewing evolution that assumes a fixed characteristic and implies decreasing  variation.",2004,fbarnett | gcarroll,David,McKendrick
1922,"Bridging the Culture Chasm: Ensuring that Consumers are Healthy, Wealthy and Wise","The paper pulls together streams of culture-related research found in information  processing and behavioral decision theory literatures, and complements them with a focus  on motivations and goals. We propose a framework that suggests that (a) the treatment of culture is useful when it incorporates subcultures, including those defined by nationality, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and neighborhood or local surroundings, (b) goals are  determined by both cultural background and situational forces, and (c) via its impact on  goals, culture influences the inputs utilized in a decision, the types of options preferred and the timing of decisions. Implications of the framework are highlighted for two policy  domains, health and savings/spending. We suggest that consumers’ goal orientations can provide a useful segmentation dimension, and carve out specific tendencies that appear to  vary across cultural contexts (e.g., satisficing, goal shifting, reactivity). A deeper  consideration of consumer goals and the role played by culture in individual decision making  can inform policies seeking to improve the quality of consumers’ decisions and ultimately consumer welfare.",2006,jaaker,Donnel,Briley
1925,Getting Emotional About Health,"The consequences of having an illness have two crucial types of stakes: for self and for  family. Therefore, the current research examines the effectiveness of health messages that present consequences for the self or family, focusing specifically on the dual role played by emotions in serving these stakes: as a provider of resources and of information. The authors theorize that (a) the valence dimension of discrete emotions influences resources, thereby  fostering or hindering the processing of aversive health information, whereas (b) the self/otherrelatedness  dimension of discrete emotions provides information that interacts with the focal  referent in the message (self or family) to determine compatibility. In experiments 1-3, the authors demonstrate that when individuals are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness, peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete emotion fosters the  processing of health information. When the primed emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, anxiety),  however, compatibility hinders processing of the message. In experiment 4, the authors track  emotions pre- and post-exposure to a health message to demonstrate that the effect observed occurs due to an increase in the negative emotional state in compatible situations when processing disease-related information. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for increasing the effectiveness of health-related messages.",2006,jaaker,Nidhi | Geeta,Agrawal | Menon
1940,"A Positive Theory Of Moral Management, Social Pressure, And Corporate Social Performance","This paper provides a theory of firm behavior motivated by moral duty, self-interest,  and social pressure. A morally-managed and a self-interested firm compete in a market  in which their corporate social performance (CSP) provides product differentiation. In  addition to acting as consumers, citizens have warm glow preferences for personal giving to social causes, holding shares in firms providing CSP, and contributing to social pressure  to increase CSP. Social pressure is delivered by an activist NGO funded by voluntary  contributions by citizens. The activist selects a target, demands social action by the  target, and threatens harm. The target can fight the activist campaign, but both parties  have an incentive to bargain to a resolution. The model charaterizes an equilibrium in the product market, the capital market, and the market for social pressure. The equilibrium  establishes a price for CSP and for activist-induced social action. The theory provides  predictions of the market values of firms, the prices of products, firm profits, target  selection, contributions to the activist, and the amount of CSP. For example, if citizens  do not distinguish between morally-motivate CSP and CSP induced by social pressure,  the activist is more likely to target the softer, morally-motivated firm. Higher quality  activists are better funded, target self-interested firms, and obtain greater social action.  Lower quality activists target morally-managed firms.",2006,dbaron,,
1997,"U.S. Dependence on Oil in 2008: Facts, Figures and Context","In 2007 and 2008, the price of oil skyrocketed, hitting historic highs. The corresponding increase in gas price was felt sharply in the United States by ordinary people, industries, the military and the government. Citizens were spending more and more of their paychecks to fill their gas tanks, airlines grounded planes to avoid the high cost of fuel, and the military saw its daily price tag for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq increase due to fuel costs. The U.S. military depended almost exclusively on oil to power its weapons and vehicles.     <br>  <br>    Economists the world over debated whether this sudden price jump was caused by supply and demand dynamics, market ""speculation,"" or the weak dollar. In addition, debate intensified over whether the world was hitting ""peak oil,"" - a time when global oil production capacity would plateau.    <br>  <br>    If strategy is about gaining and maintaining control of destiny through managing the balance between influence and dependence,2 the U.S. faced an increasingly dangerous strategic situation in 2008. Although the U.S. had traditionally been strongly influential in the oil industry, by 2008 it seemed that this influence had waned. U.S. oil production had been decreasing steadily since the mid 1980s, and the U.S. was losing clout as a customer as developing nations like China and India began buying increasing amounts of oil. As a result, the U.S. was potentially facing a situation of strategic subordination.3    <br>  <br>    The strategic imperatives facing the U.S. in 2008 were therefore first, to gain more control of the forces driving the United States‘ increased dependency on oil, especially foreign oil, and second, to take decisive action to significantly reduce its dependency on oil as a major source of energy within the shortest possible time.     <br>  <br>    To develop a greater understanding of the strategic challenges facing the U.S. in 2008, this paper provides the key facts and figures, as well as key contextual factors, to describe global and U.S. energy and oil consumption, the history and evolution of the oil industry, the global oil marketplace in 2008, and the relationship between U.S. oil consumption and national security.

2047,Non-Profits Are Seem as Warm and For-Profits as Competent: Firm Stereotypes Matter,"Consumers use warmth and competence, two fundamental dimensions that govern social judgments of people, to form perceptions of firms. Three experiments showed that consumers perceive non-profits as being warmer than for-profits, but as less competent. Further, consumers are less willing to buy a product made by a non-profit than a for-profit because of their perceptions that the firm lacks competence. Consequently, when perceived competence of a non-profit is boosted through subtle cues that connote credibility, discrepancies in willingness to buy disappear. In fact, when consumers perceive high levels of competence and warmth, they feel admiration for the firm – which translates to consumers’ increased desire to buy. This work highlights the importance of consumer stereotypes about non-profit and for-profit companies that, at baseline, come with opposing advantages and disadvantages but that can be altered.",2010,jaaker,Cassie | Kathleen,Mogilner | Vohs

In the United Kingdom, Stark (2001) presented data showing a 75% failure rate for small and medium-sized enterprises in the first three years. The risk and high failure rate is because most new ideas and technologies are not good and are, therefore, rejected by the marketplace. ",2010,pfeff,,
2074,Does Management Matter? Evidence from India,"A long-standing question in social science is to what extent differences in management  cause differences in firm performance. To investigate this we ran a management field experiment on large Indian textile firms. We provided free consulting on modern management practices to a randomly chosen set of treatment plants and compared their performance to the control plants.  We find that adopting these management practices had three main effects. First, it raised average  productivity by 11% through improved quality and efficiency and reduced inventory. Second, it  increased decentralization of decision making, as better information flow enabled owners to delegate more decisions to middle managers. Third, it increased the use of computers,  necessitated by the data collection and analysis involved in modern management. Since these  practices were profitable this raises the question of why firms had not adopted these before. Our  results suggest that informational barriers were a primary factor in explaining this lack of adoption. Modern management is a technology that diffuses slowly between firms, with many Indian firms initially unaware of its existence or impact. Since competition was limited by constraints on firm entry and growth, badly managed firms were not rapidly driven from the market.",2010,jroberts,Nicholas | Benn | Aprajit | David,Bloom | Eifert | Mahajan | McKenzie
2093,Sharing the Future: Financial Innovation and Innovators in Solving the Political Economy,"The failure to align the incentives of self-interested groups in favor of beneficial reform is often considered a major cause of persistent underdevelopment around the world. However, much less is known about strategies that have been successful at overcoming such political economy challenges. One approach that holds much promise, and in fact appears to have had some historical success, is the provision of financial assets that align the interests of winners and potential losers from reform by providing claims on the future.   This paper analyzes the role of financial instruments as a means for fostering broad political coalitions that favor beneficial reforms. It takes as a departure point the benchmark theory of portfolio choice, in which all agents hold the same (market) portfolio and thus all beneficial reforms are adopted. It then analyzes a range of historical cases in which innovative financial assets, often introduced by technocratic reformers, have succeeded at making politics less conflictual overtime, focusing on three revolutionary states that subsequently led the world in economic growth: England, the early United States and Meiji Japan. The paper draws upon the theory and the historical cases to assess the promise of finance in solving political economy challenges in contemporary settings  ",2012,saumitra,,
2099,Crossing Party Lines: The Effects of Information on Redistributive Politics,"It is often lamented that poor governance impedes economic development in Africa. One problem is political accountability. Politicians in many African countries rely on tribal allegiances that deliver the vote of co-ethnics irrespective of performance, dampening electoral incentives. Giving voters information about candidate competence presents a counterpoint to tribal loyalty and strengthens accountability. I extend a canonical model of electoral competition to show how the provision of information .flows through voter behavior and ultimately impacts the distribution of public goods. I test the theory on data from Sierra Leone using decentralization and differential radio coverage to identify information’s effects. Estimates suggest that information increases voting across ethnic-party lines and induces a more equitable allocation of public spending.",2013,kecasey,,

We analyze a model with two parties allocating a fixed budget to a public good and private transfers each period over an infinite horizon. We compare two institutions that differ in whether public good spending is discretionary or mandatory. We model mandatory spending as an endogenous status quo since it is enacted by law and remains in effect until changed. Mandatory programs result in higher public good spending; furthermore, they ex ante Pareto dominate discretionary programs when parties are patient, persistence of power is low, and polarization is low.",2012,trbowen,Ying | Hülya,Chen | Eraslan

We design a robust regulatory system such that (i) bank losses are credibly borne by the private sector (ii) systemically important institutions cannot collapse suddenly; (iii) bank investment is counter-cyclical; and (iv) regulatory actions depend upon market signals (because the simplicity and clarity of such rules prevents gaming by firms, and forbearance by regulators, as well as because of the efficiency role of prices).   One key innovation is “ERNs” (equity recourse notes--superficially similar to, but importantly distinct from, “cocos”) which gradually ""bail in"" equity when needed. Importantly, although our system uses market information, it does not rely on markets being “right”.  ",2013,jbulow,Paul,Klemperer

2134,"Corporate Governance, Incentives, and Tax Avoidance","This paper examines the link between corporate governance, managerial incentives, and tax avoidance. Similar to other investment opportunities, unresolved agency problems may cause managers to over- or under-invest in tax avoidance relative to the preferences of shareholders. Using quantile regression, we find that the impact of corporate governance on tax avoidance is most pronounced in the upper and lower tails of the tax avoidance distribution, but not at the mean or median of this distribution. Specifically, we find a positive relation between the financial sophistication and independence of boards and tax avoidance in the upper tail of the tax avoidance distribution, but a negative relation in the lower tail of the tax avoidance distribution. However, we find no relation between corporate governance and tax avoidance and either the conditional mean or median of the tax avoidance distribution. These results suggest that corporate governance tends to decrease extremely high levels of tax avoidance and increase extremely low levels of tax avoidance, which may be symptomatic of over- and under-investment, respectively, by managers. Our results also suggest that inferences about these relations that are drawn from the conditional mean and median and unlikely to be representative across the entire tax avoidance distribution.

2135,"The Cost of Constraints: Risk Management, Agency Theory and Asset Prices","Traditional academic literature has relied on so-called “limits to arbitrage” theories to explain why investment managers are unable to eliminate the effects of investor “irrational” preferences (either the asset-pricing anomalies or the behavioral finance literature) on asset pricing.  We demonstrate, however, that investment managers may not eliminate the observed asset-pricing anomalies because they may contribute to their existence.  We show that if managers face constraints such as a “tracking-error constraint,” coupled with the need to hold liquidity to meet redemptions or to actively-manage investments, they optimally hold higher-volatility securities in their portfolios.  Investment constraints, such as tracking-error constraints, however, reduce the principal-agent problems inherent in delegated asset management and serve as effective risk-control tools.  Liquidity reserves allow managers to meet redemptions or redeploy risks efficiently.  We prove that investment managers will combine a portfolio of active risks (a so-called “alpha portfolio”) for a given level of liquidity with a hedging portfolio designed to control tracking error.  As the demand for either liquidity or active management increases presumably because of confidence in alpha, the cost of maintaining the tracking-error constraint increases in that the investment managers must finance these demands by selling more lower-volatility securities and holding more higher volatility securities.  With more demand for the “alpha” portfolio, managers are forced to buy more of the tracking-error control portfolio.  Investment managers and their investors are willing to hold inefficient portfolios and to give up returns, if necessary, to control the tracking-error of their portfolios.  Given the liquidity and tracking-error constraints, investment managers concentrate more of their holdings in higher volatility (higher beta) securities.  Empirically, we show that active investment managers, such as mutual funds, hold portfolios that concentrate in higher volatility securities.  Moreover, when they change their holdings of their “alpha” portfolios (reduce or increase their tracking error by choice), the relative prices of higher volatility stocks change according to the predictions of the model.  That is, if investment managers move closer to a market portfolio, the prices of lower-volatility stocks rise more than the prices of higher-volatility stocks given changes in the prices of other market factors.

2136,A Theory of Competitive Partisan Lawmaking,"Motivated by polar extremes of monopartisanship and nonpartisanship in existing literature on parties in legislatures, we introduce and analyze a more moderate theory of competitive partisan lawmaking. The distinguishing feature of competitive partisanship is that the minority party, although disadvantaged, has some guaranteed opportunities to influence lawmaking. Our analytic framework focuses on two dimensions of parties in legislatures: agenda-based competition, operationalized as a minority party right to make an amendment to the majority party's proposal, and resource-based competition, characterized as the ability of both party leaders to use transferable resources when building winning or blocking coalitions. We find that giving voice to the minority party in either one of these ways alone results in outcomes that, on the whole, are less lopsided, more-moderate, and more prone to gridlock than those predicted by the existing monopartisan and nonpartisan models.",2013,krehbiel,Alan | Adam,Wiseman | Meirowitz
2137,Competitive Policy Entrepreneurship,"In political organizations, the process of developing new policies often involves competing policy entrepreneurs who make productive investments to make their proposals more appealing to decisionmakers. We analyze how entrepreneurs’ extremism and costs of crafting high-quality proposals affect patterns of competition and policy outcomes. A centrist decisionmaker can benefit from extremism of proposers and proposals, once we account for proposals’ endogenously-determined quality. Lower costs spur investment, but entrepreneurs extract some ideological rents. When the contest is highly asymmetric, one entrepreneur almost always wins, but the decisionmaker benefits from the threat of competition.",2013,kshotts,Alexander,Hirsch
2138,Effect of Temporal Spacing between Advertising Exposures: Evidence from Online Field Experiments,"  This paper aims to understand the impact of temporal spacing between ad exposures on the likelihood of a consumer purchasing the advertised product. I create an individual-level data set with exogenous variation in the spacing and intensity of ads by running online field experiments. Using this data set, I first show that (1) ads significantly increase the likelihood of the consumers purchasing from the advertiser and (2) this increase carries over to future purchase occasions.  Importantly, I find evidence for the spacing effect: the likelihood of a product's purchase increases if the product's past ads are spread apart rather than bunched together, even if the spreading apart of ads involves shifting some ads away from the purchase occasion. Because the traditional models of advertising do not explain the data patterns, I build a new memory-based model of how advertising influences consumer behavior. Using a nested test, I reject the restrictions imposed by the canonical goodwill stock model based on the Nerlove and Arrow [1962] approach, in favor of the more general memory-based model. Counterfactual simulations using the parameter estimates show that not accounting for the features of the memory model might lead to significantly lower profits for the advertisers.  ",2013,nsahni1,,
2139,Do Superbowl Ads Affect Brand Share?,"We evaluate the e&#64256;ectiveness of television advertising in the setting of the NFL’s Super Bowl telecast. The Super Bowl is the largest advertising event of the year and is well suited for measurement. The event has the potential to create signi&#64257;cant increases in “brand capital” because ratings average over 40 percent of households and ads are a focal point of the broadcast. Furthermore, variation in exposures is exogenous because a brand cannot choose how many impressions it receives in each market. Viewership is determined based on how much the local population wants to watch the Super Bowl. We document substantial within-market variation in Super Bowl viewership that is partially attributable to NFL team performance and the local preferences for the two competing teams. With this signi&#64257;cant and exogenous variation in Super Bowl advertising exposures we test whether advertisers’ brand shares are a&#64256;ected accordingly. We run our analysis using Nielsen ratings and the brand shares in the beer and carbonated beverage categories. We &#64257;nd null e&#64256;ects in both categories. The lack of pro&#64257;table television advertising in the largest ad event also brings into question television advertising e&#64256;ectiveness in other context where less time and money is invested in creative executions and viewers are less likely to pay attention to the ads",2014,wesleyr,Daniel,Klapper
2142,Mission Accomplished: What’s Next for Consumer BDT-JDM Researchers?,"A main objective of Behavioral Decision Theory (BDT) research – demonstrating that economic theory often fails as a description of decision making as well as gaining insights into systematic influences on judgment and choice – has been largely accomplished. This research program, published in psychology, decision making, marketing, and other fields, has had unique characteristics that combined criteria employed in economics and psychology. Now that the prominent portion of the BDT agenda has been largely completed, it is time to consider whether the BDT and greater judgment and decision making (JDM) community in marketing will pursue a new direction or just follow the topics of the day (e.g., current topics in social psychology, public policy applications of previous JDM findings). I propose a broad research area – the interaction between the evolving information environment and consumer JDM – that raises a wide range of important questions and may fit the skills and interests of BDT researchers. In addition to raising new JDM concepts and problems, the proposed area can lead to major revisions of long established frameworks of consumer behavior and marketing. It is far from obvious, however, that BDT researchers/marketing professors, who are accustomed to studying general purpose JDM topics and are aligned with the broader JDM and social psychology community, will be receptive to a consumer-centric research program.",2014,itamars,,
2143,Gandhi's Gift: Lessons for Peaceful Reform from India's Struggle for Democracy,"In this overview article, we summarize recent research in progress that examines the potential and limitations of non-violent civil disobedience through the lens of the evolution of an iconic success: India's struggle for democratic self-rule. We present a theoretical framework that highlights two key twin challenges faced by non-violent movements in ethnically diverse countries. The first is the challenge of mass mobilization across ethnic lines. The second challenge lies in overcoming the enhanced temptations faced by members of large mobilized groups to turn violent, whether to secure short-term gains from mob action or in response to manipulation by agents who stand to gain from political violence. We show how these challenges appear to match general patterns from cross-campaign data. Motivated by these patterns, we discuss how these challenges were overcome during the Indian Independence Struggle. We argue that the first challenge - that of forging a mass movement{ was accomplished through the brokering of a deal that took advantage of external shocks{ in this case, the Great Depression- to align the incentives of disparate ethnic and social groups towards mass mobilization in favour of democracy and land reform. The second key challenge - that of keeping the mass movement peaceful was accomplished through organizational innovations introduced by Mohandas Gandhi in his reforms of the constitution of the Congress movement in 1919-20. These organizational innovations took the Congress movement from one dominated by a rich elite to one organized on the principle of self-sacrifice, selecting future leaders who could then be trusted to maintain non-violent discipline in pursuit of the extension of broad rights and public policy objectives. We conclude by arguing that a key, but hitherto mostly neglected, aspect of `Gandhi's Gift'- the example of non-violence applied to India's independence struggle-lies in understanding these organizational innovations.",2014,saumitra,Rikhil,Bhavnani
2144,"`Unfinished Business': Historic Complementarities, Political Competition and Ethnic Violence in Gujarat","I examine how the historical legacies of inter-ethnic complementarity and competition interact with contemporary electoral competition in shaping patterns of ethnic violence. Using local comparisons within Gujarat, a single Indian state known for both its non-violent local traditions and for widespread ethnic pogroms in 2002, I provide evidence that where political competition was focused upon towns where ethnic groups have historically competed, there was a rise in the propensity for ethnic rioting and increased electoral support for the incumbent party complicit in the violence. However, where political competition was focused in towns that historically enjoyed inter-ethnic complementarities, there were fewer ethnic riots, and these towns also voted against the incumbent. These historic legacies proved to be important predictors of the identity of the winner even in very close electoral races. I argue that these results reflect the role local inter-ethnic economic relations can play in altering the nature and the benefits of political campaigns that encourage ethnic violence.",2014,saumitra,,
2145,Getting the Most out of Giving: Concretely Framing a Prosocial Goal Maximizes Happiness,"Across six field and laboratory experiments, participants assigned a more concretely-framed prosocial goal (e.g., making someone smile or increasing recycling) felt happier and reported creating greater personal happiness after performing a goal-directed act of kindness than did those who were assigned a functionally similar, but more abstractly-framed, prosocial goal (e.g., making someone happy or saving the environment). Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that this effect was driven by differences in the size of the gap between participants’ expectations and reality. Compared to those who pursued an abstractly-framed prosocial goal, those who pursued a concretely-framed goal perceived that the actual outcome of their goal-directed efforts more accurately matched their expectations, causing them to experience a greater boost in happiness. Evidence that participants are unable to predict this effect, believing that pursuing abstractly-framed prosocial goals would have either an equal or greater positive impact on their own happiness, is also presented.

This effect is driven by the desire to maintain one’s current state. When the purpose of saving is no longer to accumulate money, but to spend it on a status-related product, the basic effect is reversed and those who feel powerless save more. Further, if money can no longer aid in maintaining one’s current state, because power is already secure or because power is maintained by accumulating an alternative resource (e.g., knowledge), the effect of feeling powerful on saving disappears. These findings are discussed in light of their implications for research on power and saving.",2014,jaaker,Emily | Anne-Kathrin,Garbinsky | Klesse
