bmccarth,2126,1345060512,1,75176,"<p>In this paper, managers diﬀer from each other in terms of the probability they are “forthcoming” (and&nbsp;disclose all the earnings forecasts they receive), or “strategic” (and disclose the earnings forecasts they&nbsp;receive only when it is in their self-interest to do so). Strategic managers choose to disclose or withhold&nbsp;their earnings forecasts based on both the eﬀects of the disclosures on their ﬁrms’ stock price and on&nbsp;their reputation among investors for being forthcoming.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our ﬁndings include: strategic managers can build a reputation for being forthcoming by disclosing&nbsp;unfavorable forecasts that they would otherwise keep private; even though some strategic managers’&nbsp;incentive to build a reputation for being forthcoming may be so strong that the managers disclose&nbsp;even the most negative forecasts they could receive, in equilibrium some other strategic managers must&nbsp;prefer to issue forecasts without concern for their reputation for being forthcoming; an increase in the&nbsp;persistence of a ﬁrm’s earnings has the same eﬀect on a strategic manager’s disclosure behavior as does&nbsp;a (suitable) decrease in the manager’s concern for developing his reputation for being forthcoming; as&nbsp;managers become more concerned about their reputation: (a) the current price of the ﬁrm in the event&nbsp;the manager makes no forecast today increases; (b) managers who have a high probability of behaving&nbsp;strategically in the future issue forecasts more often in the present, while (c) managers who have a high&nbsp;probability of behaving as forthcoming in the future issue forecasts less often in the present.</p>",NULL,abeyer,Reputation Management and the Disclosure of Earnings Forecasts,NULL,http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2039749,,,2010,Review of Accounting Studies,,,,,,,information missing,,

We empirically test this prediction by taking advantage of the launch of an ad-revenue-sharing program initiated by a major Chinese portal site in September 2007. Participating bloggers allow the site to run ads on their blogs and receive 50% of the revenue generated by these ads. After analyzing 4.4 million blog posts, we find that, relative to nonparticipants, popular content increases by about 13 percentage points on participants' blogs after the program takes effect. About 50% of this increase can be attributed to topics shifting toward three domains: the stock market, salacious content, and celebrities. Meanwhile, relative to nonparticipants, participants' content quality increases after the program takes effect. We also find that the program effects are more pronounced for participants with moderately popular blogs, and seem to persist after participants enroll in the program.</font></p>",NULL,monic,Ad Revenue and Content Commercialization: Evidence from Blogs,NULL,http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1735696,,,forthcoming,Management Science,,,,,,,no author,,
bmccarth,2126,1345835717,1,75641,"<p>Consumers often need to search for product information before making purchase decisions. We consider&nbsp;a tractable (continuous-time) model of gradual learning, in which consumers incur search costs to learn&nbsp;further product information, and update their expected utility of the product at each search occasion. We characterize the optimal stopping rules for either purchase, or no purchase, as a function of search costs and of&nbsp;the importance/informativeness of each attribute. This paper also characterizes how the likelihood of purchase&nbsp;changes with the ex ante expected utility, search costs, and the importance/informativeness of each attribute. &nbsp;We discuss optimal pricing, the impact of consumer search on proﬁts and social welfare, and how the seller&nbsp;chooses its price to strategically affect the extent of the consumers’ search behavior. We show that lower search&nbsp;costs can hurt the consumer because the seller may then choose to charge higher prices. Discounting creates&nbsp;asymmetry in the purchase and no-purchase search thresholds, and may lead to lower prices if search occurs in&nbsp;equilibrium, or higher prices if there is no search in equilibrium. This paper also considers searching for signals&nbsp;of the value of the product, heterogeneous importance of attributes, endogenous intensity of search, and social&nbsp;learning.</p>",NULL,monic,Optimal Search for Product Information,NULL,http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/sun/documents/search_final.pdf,,,forthcoming,Management Science,,,,,,,,,
bmccarth,2126,1345836241,1,75646,"<p>This paper examines the informational role of product ratings. We build a theoretical model in which ratings&nbsp;can help consumers ﬁgure out how much they would enjoy the product. In our model, a high average rating&nbsp;indicates a high product quality, whereas a high variance of ratings is associated with a niche product, one that&nbsp;some consumers love and others hate. Based on its informational role, a higher variance would correspond to a&nbsp;higher subsequent demand if and only if the average rating is low. We ﬁnd empirical evidence that is consistent&nbsp;with the theoretical predictions with book data from Amazon.com and BN.com. A higher standard deviation of&nbsp;ratings on Amazon improves a book’s relative sales rank when the average rating is lower than 4.1 stars, which&nbsp;is true for 35% of all the books in our sample.</p>",NULL,monic,How Does the Variance of Product Ratings Matter?,NULL,http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/sun/documents/variance.pdf,,,2012,"Management Science, Vol. 58, No. 4, p. 696-707",,,,,,,,,
