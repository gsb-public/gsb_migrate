1,81791,10/30/2013 0:00:00,Sarah Soule: Why Design Thinking Is an Effective Tool for Social Entrepreneurs,78,news/headlines/sarah-soule-why-design-thinking-effective-tool-social-entrepreneurs,"A Stanford scholar discusses a collaborative, human-centered approach to solving some of the world's most pressing problems.",124,"<p>Six years ago, a team of students at Stanford University used a problem-solving method called design thinking to develop a simple, portable device â€” a sort of sleeping bag for newborns â€” that so far has helped 22,000 low-birth-weight babies around the world stay warm.</p>
 <p>The <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://embraceglobal.org/"">Embrace Baby Warmer</a>, which includes a phase-change material that maintains its temperature for six hours after heating, is an amazing innovation. Had it not been for a crucial shift in the way the students were thinking, the warmer might never have existed. Their story is highlighted in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.creativeconfidence.com/""><em>Creative Confidence</em></a>, the new book by IDEO founder and Stanford d.school creator David Kelley and his brother Tom Kelley, IDEO partner, about unleashing creativity.</p>
 <p>Rahul Panicker, Jane Chen, Linus Liang and Naganand Murty had been building a low-cost incubator for their class project. But fieldwork in Nepal, where they had a chance to speak with families, showed them that incubators wouldn't do any good. Low-birth-weight babies often develop fatal hypothermia in homes, many of which lack electricity. The students turned to a different goal, which they wrote on a whiteboard in their workspace at the Stanford d.school: <em>How might we create a baby-warming device that helps parents in remote villages give their dying infants a chance to survive?</em></p>
 <p>The students approached this challenge from the perspective of design thinking, a concept popular in the corporate world for the past decade or more to develop products â€” think Apple's iPod and Herman Miller's Aeron chair â€” that is now also being used in the world of social innovation.</p>
 <p>What is design thinking? It's a method of problem solving that is fundamentally different from other ways of meeting challenges because it is <em>human-centered</em>. The Stanford students made a crucial shift by focusing not on their own needs but on those of the people who would be using the solution.</p>
 <p>Here's an example of the way design thinking might work to improve nutrition and alleviate hunger among the most needy people in the United States. The methodology begins with an explicit attempt to deeply understand the person or people for whom we are designing a solution. Design thinkers start with a ""designer"" â€” an executive, an entrepreneur, or any team member â€” observing, interviewing, and engaging with people who might feasibly use the solution. So, we might begin by sending teams to work in food pantries and soup kitchens, where we can readily observe the way these services are used, and the way users make choices about what they eat and what they take home. We would pay close attention not only to the things they say and do, but also to their emotions and body language.</p>
 <p>Design thinking involves an explicit attempt to engage with both typical <em>and</em> atypical users, so we develop a deeper understanding of how our solution will touch many types of users. Depending on the location of a food pantry and the organization running it, the typical user may be a homeless man in his mid-40s. But we would want to talk to and observe the behavior of atypical users, such as single mothers, elderly widowers, or employed fathers, to keep their needs in mind, as well.</p>
 <p>The methodology also involves generating a great number of possible solutions. Ideally, our team of designers, with different backgrounds and training, has developed a deep understanding of the users and the problem. This team collectively brainstorms to generate many solutions. Some might seem impossible; we put them on the table, anyway.</p>
 <p>The ambitious goal is to produce a solution that captures the hearts and minds of everyone on the team <em>and</em> the users of the solution.</p>
 <p>Design thinking also stresses the need to rapidly prototype the solution so that the designers can get feedback as quickly as possible. In the case of the food pantry, perhaps we notice how many people seem ashamed or embarrassed about being in need. We might use this observation to design a program in which users volunteer at the food pantry; the program would allow them access to the food, while preserving their sense of dignity. We would speedily try the program at the pantry.</p>
 <p>Finally, design thinking requires testing of the prototype. Once we have received some quick feedback on our program, we would brainstorm again so that we can refine the prototype, or develop an entirely new one, and then seek more feedback. All along the way, we willingly throw our notions out the window and readjust our thinking again and again if our first ideas prove weak.</p>
 <p>Design thinking can be a particularly valuable tool for social entrepreneurs. Sometimes, our passion is wasted on ideas that, for reasons that may never be entirely clear to any of us, wither away. The obstacles to adoption may be too high, the end user may not fully understand the solution, or the problem may have been wrongly framed in the first place. Design thinking offers a way to discover the right problem and a way to overcome the obstacles to adoption before the solution is final.</p>
 <p>Solutions, whether they are products, services, processes or teams, that have come about through design thinking are more likely to be adopted quickly, because they have been created with the end users in mind. When it comes to social problems, time is of the essence. Take the case of the baby warmers: 20 million low-birth-weight babies are born every year; 450 die every hour.</p>
 <p>Design thinking is not easy. It requires constant creativity and the willingness to adapt on the fly. Even people who have been practicing design thinking for years need the rigor of the process.</p>
 <p>The human-centered focus, and the rigor and creativity required to maintain that focus over the entire course of the work, sets design thinking apart from other methods of problem solving. In the hands of social entrepreneurs, design thinking offers a better chance to solve the world's most pressing problems.</p>

,81736,10/15/2013 0:00:00,Baba Shiv: How Do You Find Breakthrough Ideas?,46,news/headlines/baba-shiv-how-do-you-find-breakthrough-ideas,,97,"<p>The human brain is a sophisticated instrument. At its core, however, it's nothing but the organ of an animal, prone to instinctive responses. This instinctual brain operates according to what I call the ""X Framework,"" a concept that emerges from studies on animal and human behavior, particularly those linking behavior to brain functioning.</p>
 <p>Like our primate relatives, humans are governed by two neural pathways that you can envision crossing in an X formation. The first takes us from a state of high physiological arousal, often manifest as anger, fear, and anxiety, and governed by the chemical cortisol, down to a place of comfort, typically produced by the calming hormone serotonin. The second moves us from a state of low physiological arousal â€” what we think of as boredom or apathy â€” toward excitement, thanks to the naturally occurring stimulant dopamine.</p>
 <p>If the brain is experiencing highly physiologically arousing emotions associated with stress, then our first instinct will be to stay away from excitement and seek comfort instead. Studies have shown that primates under stress, for example, will not pursue new territories or mates. Under stress, humans also hang on to the familiar. Once the brain calms, however, it becomes prone to boredom. It will then begin to seek arousal in the form of dopamine, from the excitement pathway. This is when both you and your baboon friend will seek out new territories.</p>
 <p>From the perspective of innovation this is critically important to understand, and will help you get the best from yourself, your colleagues, and your boss. Here's how:</p>
 <h2 style=""margin: 25px 0 5px 0; font-weight: bold;"">Eat right and exercise</h2>
 <p>Research shows that the best way to maximize creativity is to maintain high levels of both serotonin and dopamine, which will keep a person calm but energized. But how? The path begins with proper rest. A minimum of 30 minutes â€” but ideally up to 2 hours â€” of deep sleep reduces cortisol levels and boosts serotonin.</p>
 <p>That means arriving in bed relaxed by taking a hot shower or bath beforehand, avoiding alcohol in the two hours before bedtime, and turning off all lights, including those illuminating electronic devices, which affect the pineal gland and make people think they should be awake and alert. It also means eating lightly in the evening, and not less than three or four hours before retiring. Digesting a big meal can hamper sleep.</p>
 <p>Diet matters, too. A high-protein breakfast is easily converted into serotonin and dopamine, while caffeine is a physiological arouser, meaning it will amplify whatever emotions one is already feeling. If a person is motivated, it will help him or her; if stressed, it will agitate â€” the last thing an innovator needs.</p>
 <p>Cardiovascular exercise is also critical. When the heart muscles pump faster, they release a peptide believed to help produce serotonin. That means considering a brisk walk before an afternoon meeting â€” or better yet, walk and talk. Steve Jobs regularly held ""walking"" meetings. Mark Zuckerberg does too. The serotonin it produces not only will make a person more creative and productive but also it improves the quality of sleep, creating a positive cycle all around.</p>
 <h2 style=""margin: 25px 0 5px 0; font-weight: bold;"">Make decisions in the morning</h2>
 <p>In general, it's better to schedule your decision-making in the morning because that's when your serotonin levels will be high. Learn why (answer begins at 1:08):</p>

 <h2 style=""margin: 25px 0 5px 0; font-weight: bold;"">Engage your employees</h2>
 <p>Corporations worried about losing their edge often try to force their employees to work ""better, faster, stronger"" by applying more pressure or using threats and ultimatums. They believe that the stick, not the carrot, will be more effective in breeding innovation.</p>
 <p>Studies show, however, that stress is a poor motivator. In his best-selling book, <a href=""http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?newRequestRefinementSelectionIds=0&amp;navActionType=search&amp;productStoreId=10161&amp;navigationError=invalidKeyword&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=9602&amp;GO=Search&amp;prevSearchTerm=&amp;searchKeyword=Everything&amp;productId=68714153&amp;searchMode=mode%2Bmatchall&amp;forceDisplayRootNav=true&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;searchTerm=Thinking+Fast+and+Slow&amp;searchKey=Everything&amp;storeId=10161&amp;showCatCount=false&amp;prevRefinementIds=0&amp;ddkey=http:NavigationSearch"" target=""_blank""><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em></a>, Princeton's Daniel Kahneman explains why. Of the brain's two basic neural pathways, the first â€” from anxiety to calm â€” does not inspire outside-the-box thinking. Workers are so insecure and stressed that they creep along in terror until they find safety. The goal, then, is to get workers engaging the second pathway â€” from complacency to excitement â€” which is much more likely to trigger innovation. That shift is achieved primarily through positive reinforcement: encouragement, respect, and enhanced responsibility.</p>
 <p>Consider two case studies: Some time ago, a successful international consumer goods company that felt it had become too comfortable, tried to inspire its managers by cutting their advertising budgets but demanding the same â€” if not better â€” results. Given how humans are wired, that kind of innovation by desperation was only going to be effective among a small group of people who habitually tend to traverse the boredom to excitement pathway. These types naturally translate desperation into a challenge, and they tend to be younger. But for the majority of their marketing staff, it would never work.</p>
 <p>A very different approach is exemplified by businessman Sachit Jain. A year behind me in our MBA program at IIM Ahmedabad in India, Jain graduated to marry into the family that owned Vardhman Industries in India, a conglomerate that is one of the largest suppliers of high-quality fabric in the world.</p>
 <p>Like most men who marry into such families, he became a senior manager in his mid-20s. Jain was suddenly plunged into dealing with a textile manufacturing enterprise that had experienced so much strife that a lockdown had occurred at the factory, and the chairman had almost been killed. Amazingly, he turned the situation around â€” and not just that situation, but host of them since then.</p>
 <p>How? He started talking to his employees. In India, for a boss to sit at a table with his workers is unheard of. But Jain has persisted in regularly getting down to the shop floor level to find out what's going on. His method for instilling an innovative spirit in an organization is to ask his employees, ""What can you do in the workplace to make tomorrow better than today?"" He doesn't ask them to think about making things better for the organization. He asks them to think about making things better for themselves.</p>
 <p>On a study trip to India with Stanford MBAs in 2011, I saw a few examples of the remarkable results of this kind of managerial approach. One was the case of a worker who had the equivalent of a third-grade education in the West. He had noticed a problem: Changing the thread spindles when they ran out was a physically stressful job. It required a team of two â€” one pushing a cart with the fresh spindles, and the other constantly having to move the stool, climb up and replace the spindle, and climb down. The guy on the stool was often taking sick leave because of the physical demands, which sometimes led to falls and other injuries.</p>
 <p>In his own time after work, the factory worker began experimenting with how to propel the stool so that the worker didn't have to keep getting up and down. Eventually, he had the idea to put wheels on the stool, and then he rigged up an electric motor to propel it. In a final ingenious flash, he adapted a sewing machine pedal to the mechanism so that the worker could stop and start it at will. The results? Less sick time, less injury, and greater efficiency and productivity.</p>
 <p>To support the process, Jain drew on one of the most powerful motivators for innovation: social recognition. The factory worker earned tremendous social prestige by our visit, which included a private meeting with him to hear about how he came up with his idea. Other people in the company began realizing: If he can do it, so can I.</p>
 <p>Democratizing where innovation can come from, encouraging grass-roots ideas, and utilizing social recognition are powerful methods for encouraging innovation. But the most inspiring method is, as Gandhi affirmed, to ""be the change."" A manager who takes time to feed her own creative side well is the one who knows how to elicit the creativity of others best.</p>
 <h2 style=""margin: 25px 0 5px 0; font-weight: bold;"">Understand your boss</h2>
 <p>Middle managers with great ideas face a challenge: how, when, and with whom should they share them? Managing from the bottom up is always tricky, and that's particularly true when it involves bringing something new to the table. But there are several things employees should keep in mind when trying to inspire their higher-up.</p>
 <p>The secret to success is to determine which neural pathway the target audience favors. Those focused on traveling between stress and calm will be less likely to embrace new ideas; they're clinging to the familiar. Those riding the boredom-excitement highway will relish a new opportunity.</p>
 <p>It's not hard to figure out who favors which pathway; people habitually tend toward one or the other. Type I personalities, as I call them, don't veer from the groove between stress and comfort. They're terrified of making mistakes. By contrast, Type II personalities are those who tend to move between boredom and excitement. They typically fear missing out on new experiences and see mistakes not as debilitating but as exciting. They reframe failure as opportunity, and see challenges as something fun.</p>

1,81681,10/1/2013 0:00:00,Jesper SÃ¸rensen: How Do You Explain a New Product Category?,59,news/headlines/jesper-sorensen-how-do-you-explain-a-new-product-category,"A game-changing idea can win or lose depending on how quickly the consumer ""gets"" it.",85,"<p>The Holy Grail for innovators often is not simply to win in an existing market, but also to create an entirely new product category. But doing so raises a critical question for the entrepreneur: How do you get potential customers and investors to understand what it is you are doing?</p>
 <p>It's harder than it sounds. Consumers make sense of unfamiliar products by mapping them onto categories of things they already understand. So when Apple comes out with its iPhone 6, for example, it's pretty easy for customers to understand that it's a lot like the previous iterations. But genuinely novel products don't fit neatly into one category or another. Indeed, their novelty stems from the very fact that the ideas and technologies that came together to create the new concept existed previously in domains or categories that were thought to be entirely distinct.</p>
 <p>As a result, innovations that are totally new to the market are often extremely difficult to describe. Things that are difficult to describe are hard to understand. And things that are hard for consumers and investors to understand typically face two outcomes: They are either ignored or devalued.</p>
 <p>To give a sense of the challenge for the innovator, consider an advertisement for Samsung's Galaxy Note line. With this product, the South Korean company tried to create a new kind of product that combined the features of a phone with the features of a tablet. The advertisement showed a picture of the device with the copy line, ""Phone? Tablet? Best of both? The next big thing is here.""</p>
 <p>The ad tackles the challenge head-on; namely, the difficulties consumers might have in describing what exactly a Galaxy Note is. On the one hand, it has the ability to make phone calls over cellular networks, so it is in some sense a phone. But it is a mighty big phone. On the other hand, it has many of the features that people find appealing about tablets (itself a category that is very new to the world). But it is smaller than other tablets. So what exactly are you supposed to call it? And what exactly are you supposed to compare it to?</p>
 <p>This challenge is echoed in a review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2: ""Normally, this is where we'd talk about the alternatives on offer,"" the reviewer wrote. ""But we admit, we're stumped here. Why? Well, in our mind, there is no clear rival. The Samsung Galaxy Note created its own category, in that there were no real phablets about before.""</p>
 <p>What the reviewer ended up doing was assessing the product feature by feature, rather than provide an overall assessment like ""much better than an iPhone,"" or ""inferior to an iPad."" But if you always have to explain your product feature by feature, you have a problem. You are more likely to confuse people, or lose their attention, and you risk that the true innovations embedded in the new product may be lost. You need a shorthand.</p>
 <p>A more vivid, and perhaps cautionary, illustration of these risks is the case of Segway, which has now been around for 10 years but has never really lived up to the promises that were made when inventor Dean Kamen first launched it.</p>
 <p>Much of the reason for this is that it has been hard for consumers to make sense of what exactly a Segway is. This challenge is immediately apparent on the company webpage where they describe their device as ""a leader in personal, green transportation,"" and ""as a leader in the emerging small electric vehicle (SeV) space."" This seems a bit like claiming to be a leader in a category with no followers.</p>
 <p>One tactic innovators and marketers often use to help potential consumers understand the value of their new innovation is the analogy. In other words, they try to explain the new product by helping the customer map it to an existing product or set of products they already clearly understand. In Segway's case, Kamen tried to convey the promise of the product through analogy by claiming in 2001 that it would do for city dwellers what ""Henry Ford did in the last century for rural America."" In another instance, he said he believed the vehicle would ""do for walking what the calculator did for pad and pencil.""</p>
 <p>But these analogies fell flat. Yes, it is clear he believed the product would make walking a distance obsolete. But what exactly<em> is</em> the device? In the end, consumers simply could not comprehend the characteristics that made this the radical innovation it was. Put more simply: they didn't ""get"" it.</p>
 <p>Scholars have been exploring for years how people make sense of the new objects, products, and services they encounter. Research conducted by several faculty here at Stanford suggests that categories serve as a key frame of reference for consumers as they evaluate a new product. Several years ago <a href=""/users/hrao"">Hayagreeva Rao</a> explored the phenomenon through the lens of French haute cuisine. He and co-researchers measured the extent to which chefs' decisions to borrow from alternative cooking approaches affected their Michelin ratings. They discovered that chefs who departed from the traditional approach were initially penalized for doing so. However, as more chefs crossed over, the effect diminished.</p>
 <p>The study, Rao said at the time, suggested that ""the early bird can get the worm â€” but can also be killed."" In other words, when categorical boundaries are very well defined, as they were in this case, ""people may not understand what you're doing when you cross them.""</p>
 <p>Work by Stanford's <a href=""/users/gcarroll"">Glenn Carroll</a>, and others, looks at the phenomenon from a slightly different approach. They looked at a particular type of data storage system called disk arrays to address a seemingly straightforward question: Why is it that this product category never took hold as a recognizable entity? Their answer: Nascent markets are more likely to coalesce into broadly understood categories when the producers have sharply focused identities. ""If many firms in the market derive their primary identities from other activities,"" they wrote in one paper, ""and there are few firms deriving their primary identity from disk arrays, then the disk array producer identity will likely not be readily perceived by outsiders.""</p>
 <p>These findings have important implications for innovators who want to launch a novel product into the market. For an existing company, it means understanding that if the new product is too far afield from its identity â€” say, a computer company that launches a line of helicopters, or a Michelin-starred restaurant that opens a haute couture boutique on the side â€” it might be worth considering licensing the new product, selling it, or spinning it off to avoid market confusion. For a startup, it means recognizing that his or her potential advantage may lie in the fact that they have a more malleable identity than their competitors.</p>
 <p>To understand why this is so, consider the company ZipCar. Avis Budget Group now owns the company, but imagine if the rental giant had tried to invent the concept from the start. It likely would have been an uphill climb because consumers' existing mental model for ""Avis"" is tied up in all sorts of associations, including car rental counters, liability forms, tack-on prices for gasoline, and lines at the airport. So, explaining to customers that this new company is essentially a car rental agency, but one that operates very differently from what they think of when they hear the words ""rental car company,"" would have been extremely challenging. ZipCar, by contrast, had no baggage in the category. It established itself on its own terms.</p>
 <p>While this freedom to define themselves creates potential advantages for startups, it also carries risks. Finding the analogy that will help people understand an innovation is difficult, and the temptation is to offer the audience multiple possibilities in the hope that one will work. Consider the San Francisco-based car-sharing startups GetAround and RelayRides. Since the notion of car-sharing is unfamiliar, both try to help consumers understand by invoking well-understood concepts such as the rental car business, social networks (""car-sharing communities""), and environmental sustainability (""imagine a world with fewer cars, without traffic jams, and less pollution."") By providing multiple analogies for potential customers to latch onto, they risk creating confusion and alienation.</p>
 <p>The key, then, for a company building novel products is to resist the temptation to be multivocal; that is, to say we are ""part this, part that.""</p>
 <p>Truly innovative products are often the ones that bring ideas across categorical boundaries. But doing so creates potential confusion, and people devalue what confuses them. The solution, difficult as it may seem, is to adopt a crisp identity instead. After all, staking a claim on your identity is a key element of the entrepreneurial ""bet"": When introducing an entirely new product into the marketplace, make a choice about who you are.</p>

1,80521,5/8/2013 0:00:00,Mandy O'Neill: Why Do Highly Capable Women Not Always Realize Their Workforce Potential?,88,news/research/mandy-oneill-why-highly-capable-women-not-always-realize-their-workforce-potential,A researcher says at least part of the answer is that people are more than their potential.,91,"<p>When <a href=""http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Eooneill/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Olivia ""Mandy"" O'Neill</a> entered the PhD program at Stanford in 2000, the question she most wanted to answer was one that had been puzzling researchers and employers alike: Why were promising professional women failing to realize their potential in the workforce? Previous research into this question, which tried to disentangle people's biological sex from their gender identity, left everyone scratching their heads. For example, some studies looking at who succeeds had found that stereotypically masculine people of both sexes earn more than feminine people, while other research showed almost the opposite â€” that masculine women suffered a backlash for violating gender norms.</p>
 <p>Even today, when her own investigations have given her much clearer answers, O'Neill sounds a note of frustration as she describes the confusion in the scholarly literature at the time. ""The research wasn't coherent and really didn't explain the problem, which is: Why were women opting out, particularly the ones who looked like they should have the highest potential?""</p>
 <p>O'Neill's dissertation advisor, Stanford's <a href=""/users/coreilly"">Charles O'Reilly</a>, not only shared her interest; he also had a rich data set that held important clues. Back in 1987, when he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, he had surveyed MBA students there about their career plans and personalities. He then did follow-up surveys at four-year intervals to see, among other things, how much the women and men were earning. The Haas School provided an ideal sample, O'Neill explains, because its graduates in those days were embarking on a wide range of career paths, so their experiences could say something true about people's career paths in general.</p>
 <p>In starting their work together, O'Neill and O'Reilly thought â€” just as past researchers had â€” that gender, apart from biological sex, would bear on people's income. But instead of looking at participants' answers to questions about their gender asked in stereotypical ways (""Do you like playing with children?""), the two tried to get at something they thought might be a better sign of people's career ambition: Would they rather work in so-called feminine organizations, meaning ones that are supportive and nurturing, or in masculine ones, which are competitive and aggressive?</p>
 <p>In 1991, just four years after graduation, women were earning at least as much as men â€”in fact, women who had expressed an interest in working in a masculine organization were out-earning men. And members of both sexes earned more if they had expressed a preference for a masculine organization. Put another way, gender mattered more than sex.</p>
 <p>But eight years after graduation, in the 1995 survey â€” by which time the MBAs' income ranged from $15,000 to $2 million per year â€” women had fallen behind men. To see why, O'Neill and O'Reilly dug deeper into the data, which revealed an interesting answer: The number of hours put in at their jobs made all the difference. Quite simply, eight years into their careers, women were working fewer hours than men on average, even when compared with men who had the same number of children.</p>
 <p>That may sound like meritocracy at work: Rather than suggesting that qualified women were being passed up for promotions and raises, the relationship between hours worked and income earned seems both straightforward and equitable. But the situation isn't as simple as that. Many organizations set up workers' rise up the career ladder as a ""tournament,"" the researchers note, borrowing an idea first described by Stanford GSB economist <a href=""/users/lazear"">Edward Lazear</a>. Rather than seeing their rewards accrue in direct proportion to their productivity, employees in a tournament vie for top rank at each stage, from department head to chief executive, with the winners at each tier earning the lion's share of raises and promotions to the next level.</p>
 <p>A tournament system is sensible from the point of view of employers, who can't always easily measure professionals' output. But since workers' success depends on outperforming others in the organization, tournaments foster intense competition. More surprisingly, they also create changing incentives over time. Workers' raw potential matters a lot in the beginning, when they are getting job offers straight out of school, but as more and more people get winnowed out of the running over the years, the remaining contenders are increasingly similar in their ability.</p>
 <p>That leaves only one way to get ahead of the pack. ""As the tournament unfolds, what starts to matter more is effort, or hours put in,"" explains O'Neill, who received her PhD from Stanford GSB in 2005 and is now an assistant professor of management at the George Mason University School of Management in Fairfax, Va. ""Working hard and being willing to make sacrifices make a bigger difference at later stages of the tournament.""</p>
 <p>It's at these later stages that women start to lag men, who eight years after graduation were not only working longer hours but also expressing a greater willingness to relocate for work.</p>
 <p>Why do women work fewer hours than men do? Demands back home may play a role. O'Neill's study shows that women were doing twice as much housework and child care as men. And, as she puts it, ""Time is a zero-sum game, so hours they were spending doing that is hours they weren't spending gunning for the next promotion.""</p>
 <p>Biology surely plays some role as well, since women's fertile years â€” unlike men's â€” are limited and, in many fields, coincide with peak promotion years.</p>
 <p>Another intriguing possibility is that some women use family responsibilities as a convenient way to avoid facing possible career failure. Telling yourself you had no choice but to cut back when you had your baby, after all, is easier on the ego than going all in and losing the tournament anyway. The tendency to self-handicap, as psychologists call this form of self-deception, certainly isn't limited to women, and men might want an excuse to opt out, too â€” but they lack an alternative path as well-trod and socially acceptable as taking care of the home front. Still another possibility is that women sacrifice time at work for time at home without much thought, O'Neill says, perhaps in response to subtle messages from parents, spouses, and bosses.</p>
 <p>In short, it's complicated: Sex, social expectations, and individual psychology intermingle in ways that can be hard to foresee at the start of one's career. At least part of the answer to the riddle of why highly capable women don't always realize their potential in the workforce, O'Neill concludes, is that people are more than their potential. What they value affects what they pursue, and values can change over time.</p>
 <p>Executives who are serious about retaining talented women, the research suggests, need to understand the ways that mainstream systems for promotion â€” and organizations in general â€” aren't as gender-neutral as they might appear. Employees, for their part, would do well to think of their careers as tournaments, and taking the long view from the very start. Planning and patience can pay off in the form of work-life balance: A woman who becomes a boss and earns a high salary, O'Neill points out, is in a better position to set her own schedule, find good child care, and keep the career she wanted.</p>
 <p>Members of both sexes can benefit from looking at their life as a whole. Though this particular study focused on income, O'Neill says we need to expand our definition of success to include overall happiness and good health. ""If you're dead,"" she says, ""you can't be the CEO.""</p>

1,4891,6/1/2011 0:00:00,7 Myths of Executive Compensation,33,news/research/larcker_myths2011.html,Corporate governance experts from Stanford GSB say criticism of CEO pay might be off the mark.,94,"<p>""Executive compensation may be the lightning rod for shareholders in the wake of the financial crisis, but the truth about how pay should be structured is clouded by a lot of popular myths,"" says David Larcker, who is James Irvin Miller Professor of Accounting and Director of the Corporate Governance Research Program at Stanford GSB. He is coauthor of the new book <em>Corporate Governance Matters</em>.</p>
 <p>""Boards have been put on the defensive when it comes to comp, but the problems that critics are offering solutions to aren't that cut and dried,"" explains Brian Tayan, Larcker's coauthor and a researcher at Stanford GSB.</p>
 <h2>The 7 Myths of Executive Compensation</h2>
 <p>Larcker and Tayan's research exposes seven common myths around compensation:</p>
 <h3>Myth #1: The ratio of CEO pay to that of the average worker is a useful statistic.</h3>
 <p>""Dodd-Frank requires that companies disclose the ratio of CEO pay to that of the average worker,"" says Larcker. ""But in certain companies, high pay packages may be necessary, and in certain industries ? such as retail ? the ratio may be much higher than in other industries, such as investment banking. Boards have to consider that how much they pay will have an impact on the types of people who want to take the CEO position. You don't want to drive talented CEOs out of public companies so that they can avoid scrutiny over how much they are paid.""</p>
 <h3>Myth #2: Compensation consultants cause pay to be too high.</h3>
 <p>""The perception is that compensation consultants are beholden to management,"" says Tayan. ""But research shows that it is not the compensation consultant or whether the comp consultant is conflicted that drives excessive pay levels. Instead, it is the governance of the firm. Pay becomes too high if the board members are personal friends of the CEO, appointed by the CEO, or highly busy (in terms of total number of board appointments), etc.""</p>
 <h3>Myth #3: We can easily identify compensation plans that cause excessive risk-taking.</h3>
 <p>""It is commonly accepted that the structure of executive compensation contracts encouraged the excessive risk-taking leading to the financial crisis,"" says Larcker. ""As a result, Dodd-Frank now requires companies to discuss the relation between compensation and risk. The reasoning may be valid, but we simply do not yet know how to measure the relationship between compensation and excessive risk-taking in any precise way. How many boards can go through their plans and say, 'This feature causes risk-taking, but this one does not?'""</p>
 <h3>Myth #4: The performance targets in the compensation plan tie directly to the strategy.</h3>
 <p>""Many companies have adopted complicated bonus plans whose target values depend on achieving a variety of financial and nonfinancial targets,"" says Tayan. ""The assumption is that these targets map directly to the corporate strategy. But evidence suggests that not all companies do a good job of making this connection. It is a very difficult assessment, and requires testing the relationship between performance drivers and actual operating results ? something that is not common in boardrooms today. Companies also tend to overemphasize the financial metrics and underemphasize nonfinancial metrics that might be the real indicators of future performance.""</p>
 <h3>Myth #5: Eliminating discretionary bonuses is a good idea.</h3>
 <p>""Sometimes when a company misses its performance targets, the board may decide to give what is called a 'discretionary' bonus to the CEO anyway,"" explains Larcker. ""The perception is that these bonuses are always bad because they reflect pay that was 'unmerited.' The truth is that there are times when external factors, such as an economic downturn or change in industry conditions, reduce company performance. What the board needs to assess is whether the company still performed above expectations, even though these unexpected factors occurred. If it did, the board should reward that individual."" </p>
 <h3>Myth #6: Proxy advisory firms know how to evaluate compensation contracts.</h3> <p>""Following Dodd-Frank, companies are now required to allow shareholders to cast an advisory vote on whether they approve of the executive pay packages ? this is known as 'say on pay,'"" says Tayan. ""Proxy advisory firms are heavily influential in this vote, but it is not at all clear that their rigid guidelines are in the best interests of shareholders. For example, they automatically vote against a company if they allow things such as option exchanges that are not approved by shareholders, very large severance agreements, or tax gross ups on certain benefits or payments. These restrictions might be arbitrary and might not be appropriate for a specific company.""</p>
 <h3>Myth #7: The numbers reported in the financial statement for stock option expenses are a good approximation of their cost.</h3>
 <p>""Companies award stock options because they want to give executives incentive to create long term value, and the cost of these grants are required to be included in financial statements and the annual proxy,"" says Larcker. ""The truth is that we do not know the true cost of executive stock options. The current models do not take into account human behavior, such as the propensity of executives to exercise their options early when they are 100% in the money. The board would clearly benefit from more precise valuation models that more closely measure the cost to firm and the value to the executive.""</p>
 <p>""In the rush to assign blame for the financial crisis, it's easy to point to the all the big numbers in top executive compensation plans,"" says Larcker. ""But the truth is a lot more complicated.""</p>",Stanford GSB,Staff,302346,Case | Book,348436 | 329961,4891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/nHqOvjZ,,Energy | Entrepreneurship,"Operations, Information & Technology",Social Innovation,Asia-Pacific,,Supply Chain,,,

But another financial market - peer-to-peer lending - has boomed, and was expected to increase to $5.8 billion last year, an increase of nearly 800% since 2007.</p><p>Peer-to-peer lending brings borrowers and potential lenders together without the participation of a traditional financial institution. It is also known as social lending, a name that speaks to the perception that it offers a chance for individuals and small businesses that could not obtain affordable financing in the conventional market to get loans at the best possible rates.</p><p>But is the reverse auction method, used until recently by Prosper, the largest online peer-to-peer lending group, the best way to deliver that result? That's the question asked by Nicolas Lambert of Stanford GSB and two colleagues in a research paper.</p><p>The answer: It is not. When compared to a competing style of auction known as the Vickrey?Clarke?Groves (VCG) auction, the Prosper auction ""can lead to much larger payments for the borrower than the VCG mechanism,"" the researchers found. Even when the VCG auction doesn't perform as well for the borrower, the downside tends to be relatively small.</p><p>The paper, ""Auctions for Social Lending: A Theoretical Analysis,"" was written by Ning Chen, of the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore; Arpita Ghosh, of Yahoo Research, and Lambert, assistant professor of economics.</p><p>Prosper, which calls itself the ""eBay for Loans,"" claims a membership of nearly 1.1 million and has funded personal loans worth $228 million. Until late last year it conducted online auctions in which borrowers created loan listings, specifying the amount of money they want to borrow, and a reserve interest - the highest rate they are willing to pay.</p><p>Potential lenders vet the various borrowers for credit worthiness and establish (but don't divulge) the lowest rate at which they would fund the loan. The auction starts at the lender's reserve rate (which is known to everyone) and continues as lenders bid lower and lower - in effect, a reverse auction.</p><p>Because lenders like to spread their risk, they often are only willing to fund part of a loan, which means that many auctions have multiple ""winners,"" lenders who will loan the money.</p><p>Although Prosper moved away from the auction model after research for Lambert's paper was completed, the research makes an important theoretical contribution to the understanding of social lending, a growing part of internet-based commerce that has had little academic scrutiny. In fact, the authors believe it is the first paper to analyze the theory behind auction mechanisms used in social lending. Prosper-style auctions are used in other venues, including the sale of online advertising, and by other social-lending sites, which means the work has additional practical value. </p><p>Prosper now evaluates the credit worthiness of applicants for new loans, gives them a score, and sets a reasonable interest rate for the loan. Lenders have access to that information and can choose to fund all or part of the loan without an auction.</p><p>The company revised its methodology because some prospective lenders and borrowers, perhaps overly excited by the auction, submitted or accepted bids that were significantly out of sync with the credit worthiness of proposed transactions, Prosper founder and CEO <strong>Chris Larson</strong>, MBA '91<strong>,</strong> said in an interview with Stanford Business magazine. The move to a fixed-rate system tripled the company's closure rate to 90%, he said.</p><p>The VCG auction has two essential properties that distinguish it from other auction models:</p><p>First, it is efficient. Situations are economically efficient if there is a balance between benefit and loss and no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. In the case of the VCG auction, there is no waste of value, an attractive feature for a system that claims to be social. Second, it is ""truthful."" Lenders have an incentive to bid their actual reserve interest rate; that is, the cheapest rate they would be willing to accept. This makes it easy to predict the auction's outcome, and the optimal bidding strategy is an obvious one to all lenders. In other auction designs, such as in Prosper, lenders typically act strategically and declare a rate often higher than the minimum, in hopes of getting a better deal. </p><p>The outcome of the auction Prosper used at the time is determined using the concept of a Nash equilibrium. Bids are at equilibrium when no lender can increase his revenue by changing his bid. But the Prosper auction is not truthful so participants do not know the true reserve rates of the other players. Therefore, the Prosper auction has many equilibria that yield very different auction outcomes, making it difficult to predict exactly how much the borrower ends up paying.</p><p>Instead, the analysis yields a range of plausible payments for the borrower - one payment for each equilibrium. The paper shows that in the VCG auction the borrower never pays much more than in the Prosper auction, and in many instances can pay significantly less.</p><p>Even so, the VCG model is not used as often as the model suggests.</p><p>In a simple VCG auction where there can only be one winner, the highest bidder wins, but the price paid is the second-highest bid. However, the pricing rule becomes much more complex when there are multiple winners, as in the case of social lending. This may explain why social lending companies have been reluctant to use the VCG auction, the researchers said.</p>",Bill,Snyder,302341,Journal Article,359681,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/JYDJnfY,,Accounting | Finance | Economics,Political Econo,Health Care,Asia-Pacific,,,MBA,,

Some women are starting to go very high in the managerial ranks using this strategic approach,&quot; concludes Olivia O'Neill, PhD '05, assistant professor of management at George Mason University who coauthored the article with Charles O'Reilly, Frank E. Buck Professor of Human Resources Management and Organizational Behavior at Stanford GSB.</p> <p></p> <p>Using comprehensive interview, survey, and observational data from 132 business school graduates over 8 years, the researchers found that certain women high in &quot;masculine traits&quot; &#8212; defined as aggressiveness, assertiveness, and confidence &#8212; were also able to &quot;self-monitor&quot; their behavior. &quot;These women were able to be chameleons, to fit into their environment by assessing social situations and adapting their actions accordingly,&quot; explains O'Neill. </p> <p></p> <p>Masculine women who were high self-monitors did quite well professionally, according to the study. They received 1.5 times more promotions than masculine men, and about two times as many promotions as feminine men, regardless of whether the men were high or low self-monitors. They also received 3 times as many promotions as masculine women who were low self-monitors, affirming that masculine behavior alone does not garner success. </p> <p></p> <p>&quot;The interesting thing here is that being able to regulate one&rsquo;='s masculine behavior does not simply put women on par with men, it gives them even more of an advantage,&quot; notes O'Neill. &quot;This shows that for women who do want success at the managerial level, the paths are there.&quot; </p> <p></p> <p>The study also showed that self?monitoring masculine women received 1.5 times as many promotions as feminine women, regardless of whether those women were high or low self-monitors. &quot;There is no evidence that 'acting like a lady' does anything except make women more well liked,&quot; O'Neill said. &quot;Women with ultra?feminine traits, in fact, are still seen as less competent in traditional managerial settings.&quot; </p> <p></p> <p>The effect of managing &quot;masculine&quot; traits is significant, say the researchers, since it can have a noticeable effect on success early in women&rsquo;s careers. Even small differences in success rates at the beginning of one's career have large long?term effects. They postulate that as more and more women understand and adopt the behavior pattern they describe, the lower percentages of women currently in the upper managerial ranks could reverse out over time.</p> <p></p> <p>The study resolves the conundrum that has plagued women in the business arena: To be successful, you must be assertive and confident, but if you are aggressive as a woman you are sometimes punished for behaving in ways that are contrary to the feminine stereotype. Such negative response to assertive women has been labeled the &quot;backlash effect.&quot;</p> <p></p> <p>The paper follows upon an earlier study by O'Neill and O'Reilly, using the same data set, in which they determined that learned behavior patterns &#8212; not biological sex &#8212; may be the greatest determinant of workplace success as measured by salary and promotion.</p> <p></p> <p>

The Stanford Graduate School of Business finance professor argues that placing the global financial system on a sounder footing depends on an understanding of how the largest and most connected banks â€” the major dealer banks â€” can make a sudden transition from weakness to failure.,472,"<p> STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;In a forthcoming book, Stanford Graduate School of Business finance expert Darrell Duffie goes behind the scenes to describe the financial network of incentives and financial contracts that lead to run-on-the-bank calamities during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. He argues that success in placing the global financial system on a sounder footing going forward depends on an understanding of how the largest and most connected banks &mdash; the major dealer banks &mdash; can make a sudden transition from weakness to failure.</p> <p>In How Big Banks Fail and What To Do About It, to be published by Princeton University Press in July, Duffie, the Dean Witter Distinguished Professor of Finance, describes the failure mechanics of dealer banks in clinical detail. He also outlines improvements in regulations and market infrastructure that are likely to reduce the risks of these failures and reduce the damage they cause to the wider financial system when they do fail. The dealer banks are at the center of the plumbing of the financial system. Among other crucial activities, they intermediate over-the-counter markets for securities and derivatives. Although the financial crisis has passed, the dealer banks remain among the most serious points of weakness along the backbone of the financial system.</p> <p>Once the solvency of a dealer bank is questioned, its relationships with its customers, equity investors, secured creditors, derivatives counterparties, and clearing bank can change suddenly. The incentives at play are similar to those of a depositor run at a commercial bank. That is, fear over the solvency of the bank leads to a rush by many to reduce their potential losses in the event that the bank fails. At first, the bank must signal its strength, giving up some of its slim stocks of remaining capital and cash, for to do otherwise would increase perceptions of weakness. Finally, it is impossible for the bank to stem the tide of cash outflows. The bank fails.</p> <p>The key mechanisms of a dealer-bank failure, such as the collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in 2008, depend on special institutional and regulatory frameworks that influence the flight of short-term secured creditors, hedge-fund clients, derivatives counter- parties, and most devastatingly, the loss of clearing and settlement services. Dealer banks, sometimes referred to as &quot;large complex financial institutions&quot; or as &quot;too big to fail,&quot; are indeed of a size and complexity that sharply distinguish them from typical commercial banks.</p> <p>Even today, the failure of a dealer bank would pose a significant risk to the entire financial system and the wider economy.</p> <p>Current regulatory approaches to mitigating bank failures do not adequately treat the special risks posed by dealer banks, writes Duffie. Some of the required reforms are among those suggested in 2009 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and in the U.S. Restoring American Financial Stability Bill. Other needed reforms to regulations or market infrastructure still do not receive adequate attention. A January 2010 speech by Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, shows that some regulators are aware of the significant changes still required.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",,,302156,Book,330006,4724 | 4644 | 5077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/RI7AQKO,,Energy | Entrepreneurship,Political Econo,Global Business,Asia-Pacific,,,,,

Lattin and V. Srinivasan suggest it may be more cost effective to increase their spending on clients who only occasionally use their products or services.",277,"<p></p> <p>STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS &mdash; An award-winning paper by two Stanford marketing professors and a colleague could have major ramifications for how companies can improve business by strategically rewarding customers.</p> <p>Although marketers often rely on history, spending more on their best customers, the research published in the journal Marketing Science suggests that it might be more cost-effective to increase spending on their occasional clients, according to research by marketing professors James Lattin and V. ""Seenu"" Srinivasan with Oded Netzer, PhD '04, now an associate professor of marketing at Columbia Business School. </p> <p>The research examined Stanford alumni and their involvement with the University over a 25-year period, placing each individual into one of three relationship states &mdash; dormant, occasional, or active &mdash; and observing whether actions such as attending reunions or volunteering made people more involved and more likely to donate to the University. Although companies usually don't have customer reunions, the dynamic model outlined in the paper can be applied to consumer marketing programs as well, Lattin said. </p> <p>""Maybe people over time move from one group to the next,"" he said. ""What if you knew what helps people move into that responsive state? Models enable us to ask, What if?""</p> <p>Lattin offered casino giant Harrah's and its Total Rewards program as an example. As people are rewarded, the company can see which incentives turn out to be the most profitable. For example, someone who gets a free room upgrade might be more likely to stay at one of the chain's hotels rather than at a competitor's. ""Certain types of people like chips; certain types of people like room upgrades or free meals.""</p> <p>""With our model, we can track the likelihood that a reward will shift the relationship state."" Lattin said. For example, is a free meal or free chips more likely to move someone from the dormant category to the occasional one? ""The marketer can test the program on a sample of customers and then implement the successful programs with the entire customer base.""</p> <p>Srinivasan said the conclusions of the research are most important in industries that can offer a variety of potential enhancements to customers &mdash; such as airlines, hotels, rental cars, telephone, and cable television providers &mdash; rather than just raising or lowering prices. </p> <p>""Marketers can choose among instruments,"" he said. ""Which of the instruments helps make the relationship better?""</p> <p>In the study of Stanford alumni, getting people to attend a reunion was particularly effective in increasing involvement, Srinivasan said. Researchers found attending a reunion increased the likelihood that an alumnus in the dormant category would move into the occasional group from 10% to 68%. For those already in the occasional state the likelihood of them shifting into the active group increased from 28% to 53% if they attended a reunion.</p> <p>The authors also found that reunion attendance strongly decreased the chance that people in the occasional state would fall to dormant.</p> <p>The research and models that the three put forth helped them earn the John D.C. Little Award for best marketing paper of 2008 from the INFORMS Society for Marketing Science. The award recognizes authors who made a ""cumulative long-term contribution"" to the understanding and practice of marketing. Netzer, who did much of the research as groundwork for his doctoral thesis, spent hundreds of hours running computer models. He would have had an easier time if the study started today because computers and software are more advanced, and researchers have learned a lot about building these kinds of models, Lattin said.</p> <p>""It's now going to be easier for companies to deploy models like this,"" he said, ""provided they have the direct customer data."" He added that businesses such as Procter &amp; Gamble have a harder time tracking customer data because there is an intermediary: the store that sells the product. Those in the middle, such as Safeway, are offering more rewards programs that allow them to see which sorts of promotions work. Lattin is sure the manufacturers will want to find ways to take advantage of that sort of data.</p> <p>The professor said marketers sometimes have a challenge persuading their company's upper management to let them spend money &mdash; especially when the economy is as weak as it is today &mdash; because the company's return on marketing investment is often unclear. Lattin said this model makes it possible to calculate return on investment at the customer level. A company can experiment with just a sampling of customers, then see whether those people give the company more business than those not in the sample.</p> <p>""Marketers ask: 'How can I inculcate more loyalty in my customers?'"" Lattin said. ""They need to find things that engage them.""</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",Dave,Murphy,302351 | 302631,Journal Article,327461,4933 | 4937 | 4970,,,,Winter,2009,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/nHqOvjZ,,Energy | Entrepreneurship,Finance,Corporate Governance,Asia-Pacific,,,,,

The concept of &quot;sustainability&quot; must be expanded to include consideration of whether workplaces are good not only for the environment but also for people. </p> <p>What Pfeffer calls toxic workplace environments, particularly in the United States, raise rates of disease and mortality. He urges business, government, and the media to pay attention to what has been a shockingly neglected topic. In the present distressed economy, he says, &quot;the problem is only going to get worse.&quot; </p> <p>&quot;The lack of attention to employee needs helps explain why the United States spends more on health care than other countries but gets worse outcomes,&quot; says Pfeffer, the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business. &quot;We have no mandatory vacation or sick day requirements, and we do have chronic layoffs, overwork, and stress. Working in many organizations is simply hazardous to your health.&quot;</p> <p>Specifically, he says, epidemiological studies show that holding a lower-level position where one does not have much control over job activities and decision making puts employees at a higher risk of having&mdash;or dying from&mdash;a heart attack. &quot;There&rsquo;s nothing more stressful than being in an environment in which you have a lot of pressure but relatively little power,&quot; Pfeffer says.</p> <p>In addition, spotty or interrupted health care insurance&mdash;a typical consequence of layoffs and job changes&mdash;and the trend toward jobs that offer no health coverage at all, leads to a significant decrease in routine preventive medical screening procedures such as mammograms and cholesterol and blood pressure testing, and as a consequence, added risk to workers&rsquo; health. </p> <p>Pfeffer cites research showing that overwork and job stress lead to increases in smoking, alcohol abuse, and high blood pressure, while layoffs contribute to depression, violence, and even lowered life expectancy. &quot;There is evidence that people who experience a layoff live 1.5 years less than those who don&rsquo;t,&quot; Pfeffer says.</p> <p>The Stanford professor thus maintains that the concept of &quot;sustainability&quot; must be expanded to include not only whether corporations care for the environment and resource conservation, but also whether they are good for their employees. </p> <p>As to why the serious question of worker well-being has been given scant attention by executives, regulators, and pundits, Pfeffer suggests it may have something to do with current mercenary cultural values. &quot;There was a time when CEOs believed they had an obligation to all of their stakeholders, including employees,&quot; he says. &quot;But over time, we've come to look at even the simplest things in financial terms. Childcare, for example, which used to be a matter between parents and children, is now a service to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. This way of thinking is taking out the human factor.&quot;</p> <p>The great irony, says Pfeffer, is that most workplace policies that are bad for employees are also bad for companies themselves. Organizations that are more &quot;humane&quot;&ndash;&ndash;offering generous benefits, sick leave, vacation pay, health insurance, and so forth&ndash;&ndash;are shown to be more profitable. Pfeffer points to companies such as Southwest Airlines, Kimberly-Clark in the Andean region, and kidney dialysis provider DaVita as exemplars. &quot;I hope businesses will wake up to the fact that if they don't do well by their employees, chances are they&rsquo;re not doing well, period,&quot; Pfeffer says.</p> <p>In the current economic climate, he notes, more people will be laid off, work longer hours, become saddled with increasing work responsibilities, and operate without health insurance. The government, Pfeffer says, will almost certainly need to step in with regulation.

The prime mover, say researchers, is acquiring a position of power.</p> <p>Specifically, it is people&rsquo;s new, more elevated perception of themselves after assuming a position with more power that inspires them to take more risks and pursue goals more confidently. Taking on a formal position of power&#8212;be it managerial, political, or cultural&#8212;gives people the illusion they have more control over their organization and their world, which, in turn, can propel them to go for the gusto. In the best-case scenarios, this can lead to achieving unimaginable accomplishments. In the worst, it can lead to poor decision making and devastating losses.</p> <p>In one study, researchers stimulated thoughts of empowerment among a group of participants by having them describe in writing a time when they had power over others. Another group was asked to write about a time when they were not empowered. Researchers then measured participants&rsquo; mindsets by asking them to predict the outcome of a roll of a die. Participants&rsquo; choice either to roll the die themselves or have another person roll it for them served as an indicator as to whether they were feeling confident or not in the moment.</p> <p>&ldquo;When people feel they can control the outcome, they want to roll the die. It&rsquo;s a classic measure of the &lsquo;illusion of control,&rsquo;&rdquo; explains Nathanael Fast, a doctoral candidate in organizational behavior at the Graduate School of Business, who conducted the study with Deborah Gruenfeld, Moghadam Family Professor of Leadership and Organizational Behavior at the Business School; Niro Sivanathan of the London School of Business, and Adam Galinsky of Northwestern University. In this experiment, 100 percent of the &ldquo;high power&rdquo; group chose to roll the die themselves, as opposed to only 58 percent of the &ldquo;low power&rdquo; group. &ldquo;This shows that power boosts people&rsquo;s sense of control over outcomes, even when the outcomes are based entirely on chance,&rdquo; Fast says.</p> <p>In a second study, one group was assigned to the role of manager, another to the role of subordinate. All participants were told they would do a role play, but first they were asked to complete an unrelated activity that involved reading about an organization and rating how much control they thought they could have working in that organization, as well as how optimistic they were that the organization could do well.</p> <p>Those designated as managers were significantly more optimistic about the organization in the material they read; they thought they would have more control over the organization&rsquo;s fate than those in the subordinate group. &ldquo;People with a position of power believed they could control outcomes that stretched beyond their actual power,&rdquo; says Fast.</p> <p>This finding may explain why CEOs sometimes make over-optimistic decisions, such as paying too much for mergers or acquisitions. &ldquo;Because of the illusion of control that their role gives them, they may tend to overestimate how much influence they will have in turning such transactions into huge profits,&rdquo; Fast observes.</p> <p>In a third study, participants were again primed by being asked to write about situations in which they had been either empowered or disempowered. They then took a self-esteem test and were asked questions such as whether they would vote in the next election, to what extent they thought their vote would affect the outcome, and how much influence they believed they had over the national economy.</p> <p>Participants who were primed for power had much higher self-esteem scores and a much greater illusion of control than those primed for disempowerment. They were more likely to say they would vote and that their actions could have an impact on the world. </p> <p>The investigators ruled out the argument that mood drives people to act. They found that &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; levels were similar regardless of which group they were in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because power gives people a sense of control, not happiness, that it inspires more confident action taking,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;One implication of this work is that powerful people shape our world not just because they have resources, but because they believe they can shape the world &ndash;&ndash; and therefore they try,&rdquo; says Fast. &ldquo;People with low power mindsets do less than they otherwise could.&rdquo;</p> <p>Because those who believe they are empowered are more active and productive, managers may want to create more confident employees by giving them a say in their organizations, he suggests. On the other side, leaders need to caution against over confidence. &ldquo;When someone takes on an air of invincibility after being promoted to a more powerful position, the effects on an organization can be devastating,&rdquo; says Fast. </p> <p>What is required, he suggests, is a system that ensures critical thought. &ldquo;Research shows that carefully evaluating the pros and cons of a decision tends to reduce the illusion of control,&rdquo; he says. Instituting mechanisms that require deliberation is the key to preventing snap decisions by CEOs with little time and big egos.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",Marguerite,Rigoglioso,302206,Working Paper,318996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/7wpfgVK,,Political Economy,Marketing,Leadership,North America,Corporate Governance and Leadership Initiatives,,,,
1,4724,12/1/2008 0:00:00,Incentives and the Financial Crisis,35,news/research/berk-incentives.html,,0,"<p>In any financial crisis, it is possible with 20/20 hindsight to identify the specific proximal causes. Armed with this knowledge, legislators are invariably tempted to outlaw specific activities. After all, if these activities had been illegal prior to the crisis, surely the crisis would have been avoided. The flaw with this seemingly plausible logic is that it ignores the incentives that affect people's behavior. A better approach is to design legislation that better aligns the incentives of bankers with the public interest.</p>
 <p>Bankers are incentivized to make money. Inevitably, their actions expose the economy to the kind of breakdown we saw in October. With new regulations on their behavior, future crises will no doubt look different, but they will not be eliminated. The only way to avert crises is to treat banking in the same way we treat polluters: Create an environment that internalizes the negative externalities banking activity generates. That is, we should give bankers incentives so that they do not want to engage in the kind of risk taking that exposes the whole economy to a meltdown.</p>
 <p>To address this, we need to examine the effect of leverage. When investors invest borrowed resources, a problem known to financial economists as ""asset substitution"" is created: If the investment goes bad, the investor can declare bankruptcy and leave the debt holders bearing the costs. Because of this downside protection, risk takers have an incentive to take on more risk than they would if there was no leverage. Most debt holders are well aware of these incentives, and ordinarily they monitor the behavior of the risk takers with policies like margin requirements. By doing so, they avoid exposing themselves to unduly large losses and lessen the likelihood of a larger financial meltdown. But when the government implicitly insures debt holders by bailing them out in bad times, the incentive to monitor borrowers is reduced. The inevitable consequence will be much larger and more costly crises in the future.</p>
 <p>Government action might well be required to address this problem. But it would be a big mistake for legislators to focus on regulating leverage, the activity perceived to have caused the current crisis. Instead they need to concentrate on undoing the perverse incentives to take on risk that results from the perceived willingness of the government to bail out large risk takers. As matters stand right now, it is clear that once investment banks (or whatever these risk-taking entities will call themselves in the future) reach a certain size, they become too big to fail, and thus the entities that hold their liabilities know they can implicitly count on a government guarantee. Competitive debt markets will internalize the implications of this guarantee, and the result is that large investment banks will find that they can borrow at artificially low costs of capital, providing yet an additional incentive to take on more risk. Because smaller banks will not have this implicit guarantee, they will be at a competitive disadvantage in this highly competitive environment. The likely result is further consolidation of the industry and a compounding of the problem.</p>
 <p>To avoid the mistakes of the past, legislators should begin by taking as given the incentives investment bankers and their lenders face. It is naÃƒÂ¯ve to believe that it is possible to control these incentives by passing tough new laws regulating specific activity such as the amount of leverage. Such regulation would soon become archaic as investment bankers invent new financial products that could achieve the same results without running afoul of the regulations. Instead legislators should consider reorganizing the industry to better align its incentives with the public interest.</p>
 <p>Although a full analysis of how this can be achieved will require time and data, there are two policies that I believe are worth considering. The first, which I have alluded to already, is curbing the size of investment banks. By keeping them small, failures can be allowed in times of crisis without endangering the entire economy. Consequently, government can credibly commit to not bail out these institutions. Debt holders will then have incentive to aggressively monitor these institutions, greatly reducing the likelihood of future financial crises.</p>
 <p>A second approach would be to align incentives by reconsidering the corporate structure of investment banking. Less than 10 years ago Goldman Sachs was a partnership. If Goldman was still a partnership today, its partners would be personally liable for all of Goldman's losses. That is, it would not just be their current bonuses that would be on the line, but their entire personal wealth. Faced with the potential of personal financial devastation, it is extremely unlikely that the partners would have allowed the firm to get into its current financial straits. By reorganizing investment banks into partnerships, the likelihood of another financial meltdown would be reduced far more than, for example, through restrictive regulation on their borrowing and lending activities.</p>
 <p>One might argue that reorganizing investment banks as partnerships would reduce their incentives to take on risk and thereby hobble their ability to grease the wheels of capitalism. Such an argument might be correct: The positive externalities investment banks provide by being willing to take on risk might well outweigh the negative externality of an occasional meltdown. But it is worth pointing out that for 130 years Goldman Sachs operated as a highly successful and very profitable partnership. If those enormous profits are indicative of the value created in those years, one would be hard pressed to argue that the partnership structure handicapped Goldman's ability to take on risk or otherwise serve as a valuable middleman.</p>
 <p>I believe it is naÃƒÂ¯ve to believe that we can protect ourselves from future crises by simply passing tougher regulations. The political will to make structural changes will likely evaporate once the crisis passes. So although the window of opportunity to make structural changes is short, it would be a mistake to rush to legislative action. Congress should carefully consider how to align the incentives of risk takers before taking legislative action.</p>",Jonathan,Berk,302076,,,4745 | 4891 | 5069,,,,Winter,2009,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/7wpfgVK,,Public Sector | Social Innovation,Organizational Behavior,Global Business,Africa,,,,,
1,4690,9/1/2008 7:00:00,Should Charities Ask for Time Before Money?,43,news/research/aaker_timeandmoney.html,,0,"<p> STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;Charitable giving may be a $300 billion industry in the United States, but for nearly all nonprofits encouraging donations is the number one challenge. Recent research from the Stanford Business School shows that nonprofits can benefit financially by prompting potential donors to make an emotional connection to the organization and to its mission.</p> <p>According to a new study published in the Journal of Consumer Research in October 2008, asking supporters for their time, not for their money, is a better way to increase donations. Jumping straight in and soliciting potential donors for funds can, in fact, alienate them&ndash;&ndash;making them less likely to get involved and less likely to actually donate. Asking them to volunteer first, however, can positively shift their willingness to give both time and money.</p> <p>The reason, according to Jennifer Aaker of Stanford Graduate School of Business and Wendy Liu of UCLA, coauthors of the study, is that questions regarding time versus money stimulate different mindsets. When people are solicited for their time, they automatically think in terms of emotional meaning and fulfillment: Will volunteering for this charity make me happy? When tapped for money, they start thinking about the far more practical, boring, and sometimes painful matter of &ldquo;economic utility&rdquo;: Will making a donation make a dent in my wallet? </p> <p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;time first&rsquo; approach therefore makes the emotional significance of what you&rsquo;re asking stand out, which stimulates positive feelings and an increased belief that volunteering would be linked to personal happiness. That emotional mindset ultimately leads to greater giving,&rdquo; explains Aaker, General Atlantic Partners Professor of Marketing at Stanford GSB.</p> <p>In the first of the study&rsquo;s three experiments, participants in an online survey read a brief statement about the mission of a fictitious cancer research foundation. Those who were asked first how much time they would be willing to volunteer to the organization&ndash;&ndash;and then how much money they would donate&ndash;&ndash;offered to give nearly twice as much money as those who were asked only about money.</p> <p>In the second test, participants read about HopeLab, a real nonprofit organization that serves children with cancer. Members of one group were asked first how interested they were in donating time to the organization, and then how interested they were in giving money, while another group was asked the questions in reverse. A third group was not asked either question. </p> <p>Participants were given ten $1 bills as payment. On their way out they passed a donation box for the organization, and were handed a &ldquo;volunteer for HopeLab&rdquo; flyer on which they could leave their email addresses. The following week, HopeLab contacted those who left their addresses and helped monitor the number of hours those volunteers actually worked for the organization over the next month.</p> <p>Once again, individuals who were asked first for their time gave twice as much money to the donation box as those who were asked first to make a financial donation. Moreover, those who were asked first for money gave less than both those who were asked first about their time as well as those who were asked neither question. &ldquo;That shows that the mere mention of money serves to distance people,&rdquo; Aaker says. </p> <p>What&rsquo;s particularly interesting is that participants who were asked first about their time not only gave the most money of all, but also they donated the most time to the organization. This affirms for the researchers that what motivates people to give dollars when they are asked first for their time is not simply guilt; that is, they are not donating more generously as a way of &ldquo;buying out&rdquo; of having to give up precious hours. &ldquo;If guilt had been operating, then those who were asked for time first may have given more money, but they would have given less time than any of the other groups. In fact, the reverse was true,&rdquo; says Aaker.</p> <p>Aaker and Liu believe that requests for people&rsquo;s time elicit thoughts of the non-monetary emotional benefits they will get out of spending their time helping out a charity. &ldquo;It makes them more likely to say, &lsquo;What an interesting organization this is! Donating my time here would make me personally happy,&rsquo;&rdquo; Aaker says.</p> <p>In a third experiment similarly involving &ldquo;time first&rdquo; and &ldquo;money first&rdquo; questions, participants were also asked point blank about their personal beliefs regarding guilt and happiness. The responses affirmed that when willingness to volunteer was measured first, people reported a greater belief in the relationship between volunteering and personal happiness. Guilt did not enter significantly into the equation.</p> <p>In short, the new study suggests that asking for people&rsquo;s time connects them with the deep mission of the organization, which makes them more inspired to be involved in that endeavor in every way. Conversely, asking people for money may well cause them to disengage. </p> <p>&ldquo;Nonprofits, therefore, may want to create more differentiated ways to foster feelings of meaning in their donors,&rdquo; Aaker says. Also, she cautions, while providing stakeholders with metrics on where an organization&rsquo;s money is going can be useful, an overemphasis on dollars at the expense of emotional connectedness may actually turn off donors.</p> <p></p>",Marguerite,Rigoglioso,302036,Journal Article,327381,,,,,Winter,2009,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/nHqOvjZ,,Global Business,Economics,Education,Europe,,,,,
1,4937,2/1/2006 8:00:00,Calculating the Dollar Value of Brand Equity,45,news/research/mktg_srinivasan_brandequity.shtml,,0,"<p>STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;When I upgraded my car from a Geo Prizm to a Toyota Corolla, I felt that I had upgraded my life. Here I was in a higher-quality vehicle that was more attractive&#8212;and no doubt safer. Wasn't I surprised, then, to find out that the Corolla was exactly the same car as the Prizm, made by the same manufacturing facility in Fremont, Calif. Only the name&#8212;and the brand image&#8212;had been changed. Knocking my forehead in disgust, I realized that not only could I have had a V8, I could have saved myself money, too. And that, say the experts, is the beauty of branding.</p> <p>&quot;There are numerous such instances of &#8216;twins' all around us&#8212;products that are identical except for the branding, where one brand sells much better than another,&quot; says V. &quot;Seenu&quot; Srinivasan, the Adams Distinguished Professor in Management at the Graduate School of Business. Most managers would give five years' worth of stock options to figure out just how much brand equity is worth in dollar terms. Now, thanks to the work of Srinivasan and his colleagues in Seoul, Korea, they just may have the magic market research method for doing so.</p> <p>Srinivasan, along with Korea University Business School Professor Chan Su Park, Ph.D. '92, who was Srinivasan's advisee as a student, and Yonsei Business School Professor Dae Ryun Chang, has come up with a mathematical model and a market research method that allows managers to figure out how much more the company will earn if it invests in various kinds of branding activities. This is a significant contribution in a field in which the best that most researchers and marketing wizards alike have been able to do is measure consumers' brand image, but not its effects in dollars and cents.</p> <p>Srinivasan and his colleagues first developed an operational definition of exactly what &quot;brand equity&quot; is. &quot;Having a better product or a larger sales force is not brand equity,&quot; he explains. &quot;Brand equity is that incremental value that accrues to a product when it is branded.&quot; Simple brand awareness is one source of brand equity. &quot;If you can get your name to pop up in people's minds when they think of the product category, you've won a big part of the battle,&quot; he says.</p> <p>Srinivasan and his colleagues also have identified two other sources of brand equity: a consumer's perception that a brand is better than it really is (&quot;attribute-based&quot; equity), and nonattribute-based equity, for instance, a consumer's preference for a brand based on the cachet of owning it. &quot;If you're successful in these three aspects, an added benefit is that stores will feel a customer pull to carry your product, and so your availability&#8212;and hence sales&#8212;will increase,&quot; Srinivasan says.</p> <p>In doing calculations on cellular phone brands in Korea, Srinivasan found that simple awareness&#8212;getting the brand's name to pop up in consumers' minds&#8212;generates the largest return, followed by consumers' responding to the cachet of owning the brand (nonattribute-based equity). Attribute-based equity trails in third place. &quot;This means that a brand's &#8216;image' provides a stronger incentive for buying even than the perception that it is a better product,&quot; he explains. &quot;But greater awareness of your brand is the major component driving brand equity.&quot;</p> <p>By taking into account the direct effects of these three sources of equity on customers' choices, and also the indirect effects of enhanced brand availability, Srinivasan and his colleagues estimated that Samsung, for example, earned $127 million per year from brand equity, topping the chart of companies that compete in the cell phone market in Korea. &quot;We don't know how much they spent on advertising and other brand-building activities over the years, so at the end of the day we can't say for sure whether investing in branding activities generated more money than it cost,&quot; Srinivasan acknowledges.</p> <p>Despite such limitations, Srinivasan's model is helpful for understanding the sources of brand equity and doing &quot;what-if&quot; analyses to predict the likely impact of alternative strategies to enhance brand equity. &quot;Say an ad agency guarantees that it can increase your company's brand awareness by a certain percentage if you spend a certain amount of money. Our model can tell you what the effect will be on the bottom line,&quot; Srinivasan says. &quot;That's new.&quot;</p> <p>Because the study is the first to develop a detailed model of how the different sources of brand equity contribute to the bottom line, it can be used to evaluate the impact of alternative brand-building strategies. For instance, in the Korean cell phone market, Samsung is perceived to be the best in terms of voice quality&#8212;a perception that goes beyond what objective comparisons actually reveal. Thus side-by-side product comparison tests could be used by one of Samsung's competitors to persuade consumers through advertising that their product provides voice quality that is just as good as Samsung's. The new method would allow managers to evaluate the bottom-line implications of such a strategy.</p> <p>Coke may want to take note. In branded taste tests their diet elixir comes out on top, even though in blind taste tests Diet Pepsi takes the prize. The difference in revenues?

1,4933,7/1/2005 7:00:00,Asking Consumers to Compare May Have Unintended Results,56,news/research/mktg_simonson_consumercompare.shtml,,0,"<p>STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;You walk into a drugstore and see the familiar sign inviting you to compare the price of the store's brand of aspirin to a national brand. What do you do? According to Itamar Simonson, you may not go for the cheapest. Instead, you may choose the major brand because you perceive it as the less risky choice. Or you may not buy anything at all.</p> <p>&quot;Telling people to make comparisons, which is a practice that marketers use a lot, can be very uncertain because it can change the behavior of consumers in very fundamental ways,&quot; said Simonson, the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing at Stanford GSB, who studied the question with Uptal Dholakia, a marketing professor at Rice University. &quot;It can easily backfire. Consumers may decide not to buy at all or to minimize what they perceive as a heightened risk instead of following the advice that the marketer had in mind.&quot;</p> <p>There are several possible reasons. Previous research by Simonson and others showed that in comparisons, consumers tended to put greater weight on the comparative disadvantages rather than advantages of each option. This can make the suggested option (in this case, the store brand) less attractive.</p> <p>Comparative advertising, which can be either implicit or explicit, has long been used by marketers to frame choices in ways that are favorable to their products. Although there have been many studies about comparative advertising, Simonson and Dholakia's study was unique in that it examined the difference between implicit and explicit comparisons.</p> <p>Implicit comparisons are made when a consumer takes the initiative to evaluate two or more products. Explicit comparisons are those specifically suggested by the seller or advertiser. The product can be merely placed in close proximity to another product, inviting the consumer to make the judgment autonomously; or the consumer can be explicitly directed to make the comparison. It was the latter situation that the researchers in this particular study sought to explore.</p> <p>Simonson and Dholakia set up two trials. The first one involved selling CDs on the auction site eBay. Researchers listed a number of top-selling CDs for auction&#8212;for example, The Wall by Pink Floyd&#8212;with an opening bid of $1.99. They then framed the auctions in two different ways. In some auctions, each CD was flanked by an auction of a CD of the same title with a starting price of 99 cents. In a second set of auctions, the CD was placed between two others of the same title with a starting price of $6.99 each. The opening bid of the middle CD was always $1.99.</p> <p>The results were instructive: The $1.99 CDs flanked by $6.99 versions ended up fetching much higher prices than the CDs adjacent to the 99-cent offerings.</p> <p>&quot;We didn't tell people to make a comparison; they did it on their own,&quot; said Simonson. &quot;And when people make these kinds of comparisons on their own, they are very influential.&quot;</p> <p>To test the effect of telling consumers to compare, there were two additional sets of auctions, again with starting prices of the adjacent CDs being either 99 cents or $6.99 and the middle CD starting at $1.99. In these groups, however, auction participants were explicitly told to compare the $1.99 price to its neighbors. The result was that prices of the adjacent CDs became statistically irrelevant to what was bid on the middle disc and the buyers in general became much more cautious and risk adverse.</p> <p>&quot;The mere fact that we had asked them to make a comparison caused them to fear that they were being tricked in some way,&quot; said Simonson. So people waited longer to make the first bid&#8212;some of them even engaging in &quot;sniping&quot; behavior, which is to wait until the last possible minute before the auction closes to place a bid; they submitted fewer bids; and they were much less likely to participate in multiple auctions simultaneously.</p> <p>&quot;Being told explicitly to compare items had a dramatic effect on their bidding behavior,&quot; said Simonson.</p> <p>The researchers also wanted to find out how explicit comparisons affected choices between products in a non-bidding situation. In a different study, participants were asked to compare three digital cameras: a low-end camera with basic features and a low price; a mid-range camera with more features and a higher price; and a high-end camera complete with a range of advanced features at a high price. When specifically asked to compare the three cameras (as opposed to letting the participants decide on their own to make the comparison), many more participants chose the &quot;compromise&quot; option of the mid-range camera.</p> <p>&quot;In this case, also, the very fact of being told to make the comparison made people much more risk averse,&quot; said Simonson. &quot;Marketers need to be aware that comparative selling, although it can be very powerful, is not without its risks.&quot;</p> <h3>Related Information</h3> <p>The Effect of Explicit Reference Points on Consumer Choice and Online Bidding Behavior_x000D_

1,4970,1/1/2005 8:00:00,Good News and Bad for Women's Careers,38,news/research/ob_womencareers.shtml,,0,"<p>STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;Are women still at a disadvantage when it comes to attaining career success? Yes and no, says a new study. Women across the board seem to be enjoying greater parity with men&#8212;except in &quot;good-old-boy companies,&quot; where a woman's personal style and needs for work/family balance may clash with organizational expectations, values, and demands.</p> <p>Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Charles O'Reilly and doctoral student Olivia O'Neill have been able to tease out this subtle distinction by looking at the relationship of careers not only to people's biological sex but also to their preferences in workplace environment and work style. The researchers looked specifically at gender &quot;identity&quot;&#8212;that is, how &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot; subjects' goals and behaviors were. Previous studies have ignored the fact that gender behaviors might not correspond with one's biological sex, and this confusion has led to conflicting findings about women's professional status and career trends.</p> <p>In the brave new world of business, destiny may no longer be the result of biology, but rather of subtle interactions between sex and learned gender behavior. It may also be the result of how such characteristics are viewed in particular organizational settings.</p> <p>To test this hypothesis, in 1987 O'Reilly and O'Neill separated out more than 100 MBA students from the University of California at Berkeley into four &quot;gender&quot; groups: women who were &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot; identified, and men who were &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot; identified. &quot;Masculine-identified&quot; people were defined as those who wished to work for firms characterized by aggressiveness, while &quot;feminine-identified&quot; people were those who preferred companies that valued supportiveness and solidarity. Trained researchers observed the subjects and affirmed that individuals tended to exhibit behaviors similar to those they said they desired in firms, said O'Neill.</p> <p>The two researchers then checked in with the MBAs four and eight years after graduation and compared them on salaries, promotions, and major life changes such as marriage, divorce, health, and shifts in employment status. Those who fare the best overall are masculine-identified men. This is not surprising, say the researchers, given that the business world in general still tends to promote and reward aggressive behavior by males.</p> <p>Women who sought cooperative, supportive &quot;feminine&quot; firms and career paths seem to do pretty well across the board. Although their salaries start out lower overall, this group eventually ends up earning as much as masculine-identified men&#8212;even while they work 13 percent fewer hours. This suggests that there are now working environments that not only validate women's preferences for supportiveness and flexibility but also reward women financially.</p> <p>It is widely assumed that ambition and assertive behavior always win out in the workplace, regardless of an employee's biological sex. However, the researchers found the lowest salaries were earned by masculine-identified women. O'Neill cautions that the correlations in the study cannot necessarily be used to determine causes, but she does hazard an explanation.</p> <p>&quot;Gender incongruity&#8212;that is, acting more like the opposite biological sex&#8212;is basically not rewarded, particularly in women,&quot; says O'Neill. Masculine-identified women sometimes experience a &quot;backlash&quot; in male-oriented workplaces, she explains. That is, their aggressive style can rub their male counterparts the wrong way and can lead to fewer promotions.</p> <p>Also, women in masculine-oriented firms eventually face child-rearing and family demands, a potential deterrent to their careers. Women with families may be less willing to relocate or put in as many hours as men and so are unable to compete equally for the highest-level jobs in these aggressive firms.</p> <p>As to feminine-identified men, although they, too, go against the grain of cultural expectations, they do not seem to suffer as much as masculine-identified women. Their salaries at the end of eight years are on par with those of masculine-identified men, and they work 10 percent fewer hours. In short, the study suggests that women and men who do not want to compete on masculine terms now have valid options.</p> <p>&quot;One way to think about careers in organizations is as a series of tournaments at which employees at lower levels compete with each other for promotion to higher levels,&quot; O'Reilly says, reflecting on the results. &quot;Gaining a promotion&#8212;winning a round in the tournament&#8212;enables a person to compete in the next round. Over the years, those with less motivation and ability are eliminated, and the remaining participants compete for the top-level positions in the firm.</p> <p>&quot;What we see in this study is that those who choose to enter the tournament and put in more effort and sacrifice seem to be traditional males,&quot; O'Reilly continues. &quot;But others may choose not to play the game, including men and women who want more balance in their lives. Since we find no differences across groups in terms of satisfaction, it appears as though differences in career attainment are the result of choices rather than discrimination. However, the story for more aggressive women may not be so straightforward. This group seems to be opting out&#8212;perhaps because they don't fit the traditional gendered model. In the end, this study uses a very modest sample and, while we find the results provocative, we hardly want to claim that this is anything more than suggestive.&quot;</p> <h3>Related Information</h3> <p>Women's Careers: The Impact of Sex and Gender Identity on Career Attainment_x000D_

Researchers in the growing field of organizational ecology say it is not enough to study the companies that thrive. Answers lie in the stories of failure.</p> <p>STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;Bitten by the technology bug and drawn by the scent of riches, 10 men got together in a garage on Alma Street, Palo Alto, to launch a start-up company. They never made it. The venture collapsed before any sustained manufacture of their dream product.</p> <p>The year was 1908, and the new, new thing that drew these entrepreneurs was the internal combustion engine. Their firm, the Stanford Automobile and Manufacturing Co., shared the same fate as the Divine Motor Car Co. of Chicago, McHardy of Detroit, and more than 1,600 others that entered the industry between 1900 and 1920, only to fade into oblivion.</p> <p>For one group of scholars, however, the very existence and varied fates of these myriad enterprises do matter. With the dogged determination of census takers, these researchers enumerate whole populations of organizations&#8212;not just the Fords and Chevrolets of an industry, but also the lesser-known and short-lived businesses that make up the majority of firms.</p> <p><img src=""/sites/default/files/all/images/bk-demographics1_1.jpg"" width=""80"" height=""120"" align=""right"" border=""1"">They call their approach &quot;organizational ecology.&quot; This perspective tries to capture the full range and diversity of corporations, through their birth, growth, transformation, and mortality. Organizational ecology yields insights into how industries develop and change over time. Many of the findings in the field have challenged conventional wisdom about competition, demanding the attention of policy makers and business leaders alike.</p> <p>In December, 2002, proponents of organizational ecology will celebrate the discipline's 25th anniversary at a conference to be held at Stanford GSB. The Farm has provided a particularly fertile ground for scholars working within this research tradition. Organizational ecology can trace its birth to a 1977 paper coauthored by Stanford sociologist Michael Hannan, who is now the StrataCom Professor of Management at the Business School.</p> <p>One of Hannan's students, Glenn Carroll, has been prolific in adding to the organizational ecology literature. Carroll, who is the School's Lane Professor of Organizations, in turn taught William Barnett, now a colleague in strategic management and organizational behavior&#8212;creating, so far, a three-generation chain of organizational ecology scholars under one roof at the Business School's Knight Building. &quot;They're calling me the grandfather of the conference. They joke that it's my retirement event,&quot; says Hannan, hastily adding that he is not quitting anytime soon.</p> <p>The research program grew out of a mounting unease with organizational studies' prevailing focus on large, dominant firms. Hannan's intuition was that there is a lot of diversity within industries, with hundreds of firms that people don't notice. He also took issue with the assumption that organizations are plastic and changeable&#8212;if so, why is failure so common? Organizations are characterized by inertia, he felt, and there are good reasons for this. Reliability and accountability are valued attributes of organizations. These qualities are strengthened by predictable routines and structures, which create inertia as a byproduct.</p> <p>Hannan was looking around for conceptual models for working out these kinds of arguments when he came across exciting new work in what seemed a totally unrelated field: population ecology. Ecologists in the early 1970s were exploring several new approaches. &quot;That had a big impact on me,&quot; Hannan says. With John Freeman of the University of California, Berkeley, he wrote the seminal paper &quot;The Population Ecology of Organizations.&quot;</p> <p>The research tradition's name tends to provoke suspicion. Business people might say that it's a jungle out there, but surely serious scholars shouldn't confuse man-made organizations with the world of plants and animals. The academics stress that, indeed, their approach is not about turning organizational studies into a natural science. &quot;Ecology was used as a source of inspiration,&quot; Carroll says, &quot;but not as a source for understanding organizations.&quot; The ecological twist to organizational studies includes an emphasis on the fact that each organization's environment is made up of other organizations. It also shifts the analysis up from a single organization to the level of whole populations of organizations.</p> <p>Most industry studies would define the relevant players as companies that have opened for business. This doesn't satisfy the organizational ecologists. They note that before an organization is formally launched, the founders have to work hard developing their plans and assembling resources. Some of these activities culminate in successful births, but others are aborted or stillborn. Studies that begin at the organization's legal incorporation or commencement of production thus underestimate mortality rates and the degree of difficulty involved in entrepreneurial activity.</p> <p>The automobile industry is a case in point. In a 1994 study, Carroll, Hannan, and their collaborators looked at producers and preproducers&#8212;defined as firms that had begun some form of organizing effort but had not reached production&#8212;for almost a century since 1886. They found that historians and economists have tended to overlook the astonishing number of hopeful producers, especially in the industry's early years. They count 3,845 preproduction organizing attempts in the United States, of which only 11 percent succeeded in transitioning to the production stage.</p> <p>Collecting data of this kind is no walk in the park. It usually involves hundreds of hours of interviews and archival research. Tracking down members of a population and recording their characteristics requires the tenacity of a detective on a chase and the attention to detail of an archaeologist on a dig. Clues come from unlikely sources. For the auto industry study, researchers relied partly on the 1,568-page Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805&#150;1942 published for vintage car hobbyists and collectors. Carroll's study on the microbrewery movement drew on collectors of beer mats.</p> <p>Organizational ecologists suggest that the failure to appreciate the full diversity of organizations within an industry may translate into weak policy. &quot;For example, in current policy debates concerning the competitiveness of a nation's firms in the international marketplace, this issue often gets analyzed on the basis of a few anecdotes or highly publicized cases,&quot; Carroll and Hannan write in their book, The Demography of Corporations and Industries. Similarly, discussions about the ability of Western nations and Japan to meet the pension burden of baby-boomers tend to focus on national social security systems and large old corporations, when in fact the greatest needs are generated by small new firms lacking private pension coverage.</p> <p>Today, there is an international network of some 100 scholars working through an organizational ecology perspective. The approach has merited an entry in the forthcoming International Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (2002) and is recognized as a core specialty in organizational studies textbooks. A growing number of industries have been scrutinized through this lens, ranging from disk drive manufacturing to wineries and from airlines to auditing.</p> <h4>THE NATURE OF COMPETITION </h4> <p>One of the main insights of organizational ecology is that the environment of a firm is made up largely of other firms. Scholars in this tradition therefore have looked closely at how organizations affect each other. A key theory put forward in the original paper by Hannan and Freeman is &quot;density dependence,&quot; which says that organizations' vital rates&#8212;their founding rates, growth, and mortality&#8212;depend on the total number of organizations within the relevant population. Population density is said to have two separate effects: through legitimation and through competition. </p> <p>Legitimation is the process by which a certain way of doing things comes to be seen as natural or taken for granted. Legitimation increases founding rates and reduces mortality rates. Competition arises when organizations need to rely on the same pool of resources, such as capital and customers. Competition has the opposite effect of legitimation: It reduces founding rates and raises mortality rates. </p> <p>Rising population density increases both legitimation and competition. However, the force of legitimation is stronger when the population density is rising from a low base, such as in the early history of an industry. The competition effect is stronger at higher densities. Combining both effects, the theory predicts that founding rates will show an inverted U&#150;shape relationship with density, first rising as legitimation increases, then falling as competition kicks in. For the same reason, mortality rates should show a U-shape pattern, falling at first, then rising. The basic tenets of density dependence theory have been widely accepted and demonstrated to apply in many contexts. </p> <p>A newer take on the organizational environment is the &quot;Red Queen&quot; theory, which highlights the relative nature of progress. The theory is borrowed from ecology's Red Queen hypothesis that successful adaptation in one species is tantamount to a worsening environment for others, which must adapt in turn to cope with the new conditions. The theory's name is inspired by the character in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass who seems to be running but is staying on the same spot. In a 1996 paper, William Barnett describes Red Queen competition among organizations as a process of mutual learning. A company is forced by direct competition to improve its performance, in turn increasing the pressure on its rivals, thus creating a virtuous circle of learning and competition. </p> <p>Barnett and David McKendrick of the University of California, San Diego, have tested this theory against data on the global hard disk drive industry. Tracking more than 150 firms over four decades, they found that those with a history of enduring competition had a higher chance of survival than those that avoided competition by technological or geographic differentiation. In line with Red Queen theory, it appears that isolation from competition, while having short-term advantages, deprives an organization of the long-term benefit of an ecology of learning, thus stymieing innovation. Their study also suggests that a lack of domestic competitive experience can prove to be a critical disadvantage when a firm is thrust into global competition.</p> <h4>AGING AND ADAPTING</h4> <p>Organizational ecology has helped to illuminate what happens to industries over time. Many other studies have suggested that young organizations suffer a so-called &quot;liability of newness&quot; and have a higher risk of failure than old ones. Research in organizational ecology challenges this conclusion. Its more comprehensive data suggest that what seems like the effect of age might really be an effect of size: Infant companies may be vulnerable because they are small, not because they are young. When size is taken into account, the liability of newness often is canceled out by the liability of obsolescence. </p> <p>One of the key challenges that organizations face as they age is the need to adapt to changing circumstances. Hannan's original hunch continues to be borne out by organizational ecology research: Change is easier said than done. The social and economic environment at the time of an organization's founding can have an enduring impact on its mission, structure, and operation. Those that try to transform core elements of their structure often experience increased risk of failure. </p> <p>The scholars do not claim that organizational change is always dangerous. In the context of dramatic environmental shift, it may be necessary and beneficial to change core organizational features. However, in most cases the process of change itself can be so disruptive in the short term that the organization never gets to see the long-term benefit. </p> <p>The opposing view, that organizational change is helpful and simple, may arise from case studies of successful organizations&#8212;the kind found in popular management books. These star firms may have undergone successful transformations, but their experience is not representative of the vast population of firms. &quot;It is tempting&#8212;and many analysts succumb&#8212;to infer from this information that, had other organizations attempted the same changes, they too would have experienced success. Unfortunately, this inference comes from considering data that are heavily biased toward the successful firms,&quot; Carroll and Hannan write.</p> <p>Of course, an enduring industry, taken as a whole, can be seen to adapt to its changing environment. But organizational ecology holds that the driving mechanism for an industry's evolution is unlikely to be the adaptation of its individual firms. Instead, it is through the selective replacement of outdated organizations that industries adapt. In the airline industry, for example, the once-dominant Pan Am, TWA, and Eastern are all no more. Old household names in retailing such as Montgomery Ward, Sears, and J.C. Penney have given way to Wal-Mart and Target. And steel giants such as Bethlehem and U.S. Steel have lost out to mini-mills such as Nucor. Thus, companies die while industries evolve. One of the current forays in this research direction is the Stanford Project on Emerging Companies, or SPEC, which Hannan directs together with James Baron, the Walter Kenneth Kilpatrick Professor of Organizational Behavior and Human Resources.</p> <p>The project tracked the evolution of nearly 200 high-technology startups in Silicon Valley between 1980 and 1996, and was later extended to mid-2001, creating probably the most comprehensive database on the histories, structures, and human resource practices of this global center of entrepreneurship. </p> <p>The study found several different basic models for employment relations. The most common was what the researchers call the &quot;engineering&quot; model, which involves selecting staff based on specific task abilities, using challenging work as the basis for employee attachment to the firm, and controlling and coordinating employee effort through peer groups. Some firms later transitioned to a &quot;bureaucracy&quot; model, in which control becomes more formalized. </p> <p>The researchers have found that&#8212;in line with organizational ecology's theories about the disruptive effects of change&#8212;companies that reorganized their human resource blueprints tended to suffer higher employee turnover and diminished performance. Enterprises in which the blueprint changed were more than twice as likely to fail as similar firms with blueprints that were stable. Over a three-year period, the latter firms grew at almost triple the rate of the former. </p> <p>Personnel changes at the top are not disruptive as such. It is when chief executives change employment relationships that staff turnover increases. In fact, changing the blueprint seems to be most disruptive when it is implemented by the company's first CEO, who then stays on. This could be because the founder&#150;CEO's continued presence serves as a reminder that the organization has deviated from its original model. </p> <p>The findings are especially significant, the scholars note, because it is hard to imagine a setting in which constant flux is more prevalent and where organizational change seems more justified than Silicon Valley. Given the benefits of staying the course, the authors recommend that entrepreneurs should pay more attention to picking an appropriate organizational model from the start. The study challenges the view&#8212;popular in the heyday of Silicon Valley's &quot;built to flip&quot; ethos&#8212;that steady organization-building is pass&eacute; in a new economy flying at Internet speed. </p> <p>They add that the initial blueprint at founding should be a compromise between the current and the expected future needs&#8212;a point that few company founders seem to care about. &quot;It's by no means uncommon to see a founder spend more time and energy fretting about the scalability of the phone system or IT platform than about the scalability of the culture and practices for managing employees,&quot; write Hannan and Baron. </p> <p>A quarter-century since the publication of his seminal paper, Hannan says his own thinking has evolved. As one looks more closely at what exactly these organizational forms are that make up a population, it is clear that they are not merely manifestations of formal technical features. &quot;It's clear that they are social constructions, rooted in identities, and at some level as cultural as you can get,&quot; he says. </p> <p>Hannan does not claim to be setting the agenda for organizational ecology. The scholars in this area draw on certain shared analytical ideas but, like the industries they study, organizational ecology today is marked by theoretical diversity. This is good news, Hannan says: &quot;It assures that talented young people still join it.&quot; It may not be long, therefore, before they start calling him a great-grandfather. </p> <h4>OLD ASSUMPTIONS CHALLENGED</h4> Organizations change easily and often. Actually, the research shows inertia reigns. The relevant players in an industry are companies that have opened for business. Industries are also shaped by ideas from companies that are aborted or stillborn. Companies without competitors have the best chance of survival. Companies with enduring competition are better survivors. New organizations are the most likely to fail. It is not their youth but their small size that is the biggest risk factor. Personnel changes at the top of a company are disruptive. It is more disruptive for existing executives to change the company blueprint.   <h3>Related Information</h3> <p></p> <p>The Red Queen in Organizational Creation and Development, William P.

1,5069,5/1/2002 0:00:00,Don't Blame Trade Liberalization for Labor Market Chaos,55,news/research/wacziarg_trade_liberalization_2002.html,,0,"<h4></h4>
 <p>Antiglobalization protests took a violent turn when the World Trade Organization met in Seattle in 1999. Impassioned activists blamed trade liberalization policies in developing countries for a variety of ills. Chief among them were the claims that such policies have an adverse impact on countries' growth rate, and that increased trade leads to tectonic shifts in labor sectorsâ€”from agriculture to manufacturing, for exampleâ€”that result in a multitude of problems such as the displacement of large numbers of workers, the abandonment of traditional ways of life, a deterioration of the environment, and massive unemployment.</p>
 <p>""Trade economists have long known that a country opening up to trade will specialize in certain sectors, putting resources into producing goods and services that are more efficient, and abandoning those that are relatively inefficient,"" says Romain Wacziarg, assistant professor of economics at Stanford GSB. ""That's called comparative advantage."" It is why some structural realignment can be expected in a country's work force after liberalization of trade.</p>
 <p>But to Wacziarg's surprise, recent research he conducted found little or no evidence of shuffling of workers in the aftermath of trade liberalization. ""I thought I would be able to quantify which sectors grew or diminished,"" he says.</p>
 <p>Wacziarg and co-author Jessica Seddon, a doctoral student at Stanford Business School, compared statisticsâ€”such as head count before and after liberalizationâ€”from 26 developing countries that had clear and discernible breaks in their trade policies. They did not include developed countries in their sample, because trade liberalization efforts cannot be isolated from other policies such as monetary policy, privatization of industries, or prior liberalization incidents. ""For developing countries that go suddenly from being closed to trade to being open to trade overnight, or over a period of a year or so, we should see significant and unclouded results,"" he says.</p>
 <p>Using information consistent across countries from surveys by labor and industrial development organizations affiliated with the United Nations, Wacziarg and Seddon found very little change in the structure of labor sectors within five years of liberalization; what shifts did occur were either small or not statistically significant. ""In general, countries like Poland that have very flexible labor markets where laborers are allowed to move around tend to have more movements. And countries like Spain that tend to use regulations to create safety nets, for example, that prevent workers from being fired, have less movement,"" says Wacziarg.</p>
 <p>Domestic policies enacted to offset potential shocks to the labor market are one explanation for the unexpected lack of labor migration. These measures also tended to actively counter the positive effects of liberalization.</p>
 <p>""If a country removes a tariff on a good, for example, it's going to start competing with goods from foreign countries because foreign goods can now enter the country at a competitive price,"" Wacziarg says. ""So to remedy this, governments enact domestic subsidies to the industry to restore the competitive advantage, which had been lost with tariffs."" He cites the Philippines in 1988 and Turkey in 1990 as examples.</p>
 <p>""It's clearly not the case that you have the post-liberalization sector-level upheaval that activists claim,"" he says. ""If it happens, the shuffling can take something like 20 years, and that's much less of a problem and allows workers to be retrained.""</p>
 <p>In a separate, related study, he found countries that adopted open trade policies did experience measurable gains in the form of economic growth. Examining the link between trade policy and economic growth in 57 countries from 1970 to 1989, Wacziarg developed an index for measuring trade policy openness and found that every 10 percentage point increase in the ratio of trade to gross domestic product resulting from changes in trade policy alone is associated with a 0.67 percentage point increase in a country's annual growth rate.</p>
 <p>""If you compound that over several years, the consequences for a country's average per capita income can be far-reaching,"" he says. ""The implications of this for a country like China are enormous, just because of its sheer size. Add in India, another country with vast potential, and something like four-tenths of the world's population could yet benefit from greater openness to international trade.""</p>",Helen K.,Chang,309151,Working Paper,317501,4745,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://imgur.com/QwyHKil,,Political Economy,Economics,Nonprofit,South America,,,PhD,,
1,4745,6/1/1999 0:00:00,"Stock Options, It's all in the Timing",37,news/research/compensation_stock.shtml,,0,"<p>STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS&#8212;Every spring, a company's shareholder prospectus uncovers the glut of salary and stock options enjoyed by top corporate officers. There has been suspicion, though little hard evidence, that managers may actively try to boost the value of their options before the yare awarded. But recent research by GSB faculty member Ron Kasznik reveals that some top executives do indeed manage the timing of key company announcements, such as earnings projections, to increase the worth of their awards.</p> <p>Working with David Aboody,assistant professor of accounting at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management,Kasznik has examined how compensation incentives affect executives' decisions to disclose information. Using data from 572 firms that awarded options on almost the same dates yea rafter year, the researchers looked at the compensation for each firm's chief executive officer over a five-year period ending in 1996. In their examination of 2,039 scheduled CEO stock option awards, they discovered that the pattern of stock price movements,analyst forecast revisions, and management earnings forecasts around the time of the awards is significantly different from the pattern observed for these firms at other times. &quot;This may be the first time a link has been shown between CEOs' and other top managers' compensation and the decision to voluntarily disclose information,&quot; salsas, who is an assistant professor of accounting.</p> <p>The researchers noticed that stock price increases occurred after, rather than before,the option award dates. &quot;We also found that before the award date they were more likely to disclose bad news and they tended to wait with good news until after the award date,&quot; says Kasznik. Rushing bad news about lackluster earnings just before an option award can push the stock price (and exercise price of the option) down, thereby allowing greater profit for the executive when he exercises his option some time later--assuming,of course, that stock prices continue to rise.</p> <p>Managing the market's expectation for the stock downward can result in significant CEO financial gains. The authors calculated that for every $1 reduction in exercise price, the value of each option increases by approximately 68 cents. On an average CEO grant of65,000 options, a single dollar reduction in exercise price would reap a $44,200 gain. The researchers found that the estimated gain was particularly high among chief executives whose fixed award dates preceded earnings announcements, providing them with greater incentives to manage their voluntary disclosures.</p> <p>The study is relevant to the huge growth in CEO compensation over the last two decades,much of it in the form of skyrocketing stock options. The percentage of chief executives receiving new stock option grants increased from 30 percent in 1980 to nearly 70 percent in 1994, report the authors. While non-option compensation, such as salary and bonus,nearly doubled to an average $1.3 million over that period, the average estimated value of annual option awards grew six times, from $200,000 to $1.2 million.</p> <p>Aboody and Kasznik's research was made possible by new Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules issued in 1992. They require more details about top executives' pay be made public than had been available before. Proxy statements now report an option's duration and expiration date, which enabled the researchers to determine the exact date of the stock option award, a key factor in their analysis. Nearly all stock option awards are granted with a fixed exercise price that equals the stock price on the date of the award. Many companies also have a regular schedule for awarding options to their top managers. That feature allowed the researchers to test their hunch that CEOsmanage their disclosures, such as positive or negative product and earnings forecasts.They screened out cases in which top managers might have influenced the timing of the awards themselves.</p> <p>Playing with disclosure dates does not seem to expose executives to the same level of legal liability as other forms of insider trading, says Kasznik. After all, a CEO may be able to manipulate an option price lower, but it doesn't create a profit until the option is exercised some time later. There are no guarantees: The CEO might never profit if the stock price goes south before the option can be cashed out. &quot;It's a gray area,&quot;says Kasznik.</p> <p>One way to minimize CEOs' incentive to manipulate disclosures in this way is to set award dates after quarterly announcements, says Kasznik. For now, the study sheds light on corporate disclosure decisions, particularly related to voluntary disclosures of bad news,and may also be of value to accountants and compensation consultants who advise senior executives on how to make the most of their compensation packages.</p> <h3>Related Information</h3> <p>CEO Stock Option Awards and Corporate Voluntary Disclosures
